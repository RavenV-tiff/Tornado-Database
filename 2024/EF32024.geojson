A tornado moved onshore Panama City Beach in the Lower Grand Lagoon area along Spyglass Drive. Significant damage occurred to several homes, including the complete destruction of one beachfront home. The damage at this location was determined to support an EF-3 rating with max winds estimated at 140 mph. Significant damage to homes and businesses continued as the tornado moved northeast across and along Thomas Drive where two apartment building were heavily damaged. EF-3 damage was again noted at a large boat storage facility which suffered significant structural failure. The tornado continued northeastward across Grand Lagoon and through the Bay Point Golf Club, causing additional damage to homes, before crossing Saint Andrew Bay. The damage in Panama City, after crossing the bay was more sporadic and less intense, supportive of EF-1 intensity. The tornado appears to have dissipated shortly after crossing West 23rd Street. Thanks to Bay County Emergency Management for assistance with the damage survey.", "f_scale": 3, "wind": 140, "source": "NWS Storm Survey", "state_1": "FL", "state_2": null, "state_3": null, "spc_id": null, "ncei_id": "1149634, 1150256", "tornado_type": "Tornado", "storm_morphology": "Classic supercell", "sub_morphology": "RM discrete cell", "satellite_scar": true, "tds": true, "tropical_cyclone": false, "last_certified": "2024-04-28T13:14:44", "satellite needs review": false, "storm_motion": 40, "storm_direction": 228, "vrot": 76, "nrot": 2.59, "meso_diameter": 1.25, "arl": 1995, "radar_distance": 26.99, "radar": "KEVX", "morphology_confidence_high": true, "tds_confidence_high": true, "satellite_scar_degree": "moderate", "radar_scan_time": "2024-01-09T11:29:56" }, "geometry": { "type": "LineString", "coordinates": [ [ -85.753, 30.138 ], [ -85.752639768999984, 30.13844848399998 ], [ -85.743970869, 30.149062465999975 ], [ -85.69461822300002, 30.189578072000018 ], [ -85.691184996, 30.191803720999985 ] ] } },

Video shared on social media showed the tornado rapidly strengthened west of Glacier Hill Lakes RV Resort, causing significant damage to a grove of trees west of the resort. After crossing a field, the tornado moved through the center of the resort, lofting campers and snapping trees. Two individuals at the resort suffered injuries that required hospitalization. The tornado continued eastward toward Wapak-Freyburg Road and caused significant damage to the Resort clubhouse and residential homes on the west side of the road. The collective damage done to the trees and buildings within this corridor of damage justified wind estimates of 140 mph, EF-3. The tornado moved into an open field east of Wapak-Freyburg Road at an unknown intensity.\nThree-tenths of a mile south of Pusheta Road, the tornado caused significant tree damage to three separate groves of trees as it neared Town Line Road. Aerial images provided by the Auglaize County EMA/CERT confirmed the tornado was still strong, at least EF-2 strength, south of Pusheta Road. The tornado likely remained fairly strong as it impacted homes and outbuildings along Town Line Road, Ashburn Road, and Geyer Road. A brief weakening period, or narrowing of the tornado was observed near Geyer, where the tornado remained mainly over open fields.\nThe next period of intensification occurred between State Route 65 and Valley Road. Damage to a few homes and outbuildings, along with significant damage to a few groves of trees confirmed this period of intensification. The tornado began to make a more significant southeast turn between Wrestle Creek Road and Valley Road. The strong, likely EF2 tornado continued to move southeastward and entered Logan County at 1843EST, just north of Santa Fe.\nThe tornado continued east-southeast across much of Logan County before ending at 1916EST, 3 miles west-southwest of West Mansfield. The tornado began in Auglaize County at 1829EST, 3 miles north of Botkins and moved east-southeast, entering Logan County at 1843EST, just north of Santa Fe. Areas of signifincant tree damage occurred along the path of the tornado across northwest Logan County.\nThe tornado strengthened as it approached the village of Lakeview, producing severe damage over much of the Lakeview area, beginning along Pine Street and Poplar Court. On Poplar Court, one single family residence was destroyed, with all walls collapsed. A corridor of severe damage continued directly southeast across Main Street, where wall collapse was noted along one business building and another well built construction was destroyed. Another single family home on North Oak Street, just to the east of U.S. Route 33 and west of Indian Lake, also had all walls collapsed from the tornado. The most significant damage occurred along this stretch of Lakeview, with maximum winds estimated to be up to 155 mph, or EF-3. The width of the tornado was a half mile at this point. Three fatalities and 25 injuries occurred in the Lakeview area.\nDamage, primarily of EF-2 magnitude, continued southeast of Lakeview, affecting areas near U.S. Route 33 and State Route 366. The survey team noted roofs removed from single family homes, several outbuildings destroyed and also destruction of numerous manufactured homes. One business near the intersection of U.S. Route 33 and Township Highway 239 had total wall collapse, indicative of 140 mph winds, or low end EF-3 damage.\nThe tornado then crossed a portion of Indian Lake and moved across Orchard Island. Numerous manufactured homes were completely destroyed in a mobile home park area at Orchard Island, with the damage on Orchard Island rated as high end EF-2.\nThe tornado moved over another section of Indian Lake, producing damage over a community on the eastern side of the lake, affecting Park Drive, Maple Street and Walnut Street. Several homes had their roofs completely removed, although most walls remained standing.\nThe tornado continued to move to the southeast, crossing State Route 366 and State Route 117 to the north of Huntsville. The tornado had weakened to EF-1 intensity at this point, with hardwood tree damage and outbuilding damage or destruction noted. Damage became much more sporadic and weaker across eastern Logan County with some minor tree damage noted just southwest of West Mansfield. The tornado is believed to have dissipated near County Road 8, just east of State Route 292.", "f_scale": 3, "wind": 155, "source": "NWS Storm Survey", "state_1": "OH", "state_2": null, "state_3": null, "spc_id": null, "ncei_id": "1166417, 1166418", "tornado_type": "Tornado", "storm_morphology": "HP supercell", "sub_morphology": "RM cell in cluster", "satellite_scar": true, "tds": true, "tropical_cyclone": false, "last_certified": "2024-07-06T12:53:15", "satellite needs review": false, "storm_motion": 33, "storm_direction": 281, "vrot": 83, "nrot": 2.0, "meso_diameter": 1.15, "arl": 6410, "radar_distance": 64.79, "radar": "KILN", "morphology_confidence_high": true, "tds_confidence_high": true, "satellite_scar_degree": "moderate", "radar_scan_time": "2024-03-14T23:48:02" }, "geometry": { "type": "LineString", "coordinates": [ [ -84.16639742000001, 40.519252591999987 ], [ -84.152943460000017, 40.521438346000025 ], [ -84.147997466, 40.521805348999976 ], [ -84.145508376, 40.522058173 ], [ -84.144038525999974, 40.522066328999983 ], [ -84.139800636000018, 40.52195215 ], [ -84.13436111599998, 40.522025551000013 ], [ -84.130477277000011, 40.522050018000016 ], [ -84.128642646, 40.522074483999972 ], [ -84.122055140999976, 40.52143019 ], [ -84.116529790000016, 40.520916381 ], [ -84.112517206, 40.520533060999981 ], [ -84.107699958000012, 40.520076335999988 ], [ -84.100736944, 40.519570672999976 ], [ -84.094342557, 40.51889373 ], [ -84.087883798, 40.517874226 ], [ -84.080523815999982, 40.516642644 ], [ -84.071537901999989, 40.514671583 ], [ -84.062933375999989, 40.512518236 ], [ -84.052740981999989, 40.510217994000016 ], [ -84.044951847, 40.508945485000027 ], [ -84.034952571000019, 40.507738212 ], [ -84.028751304000025, 40.507493491 ], [ -84.024664131, 40.50741167000001 ], [ -84.023011890000021, 40.507150634000027 ], [ -84.021252361, 40.506742762999977 ], [ -84.018012253, 40.505649656 ], [ -84.011167254999975, 40.503055494000023 ], [ -84.005008902999975, 40.500820192 ], [ -83.998614517000021, 40.498682717 ], [ -83.993722167999977, 40.49740999 ], [ -83.988786903, 40.496235142999979 ], [ -83.982730475999972, 40.494951677000017 ], [ -83.979647144000012, 40.494454250999979 ], [ -83.968467697, 40.492871396999988 ], [ -83.958961948000024, 40.491778063000027 ], [ -83.950164303, 40.490619437000021 ], [ -83.944456562000028, 40.489934043 ], [ -83.938475461, 40.488727837 ], [ -83.931265683999982, 40.486916372 ], [ -83.926115842, 40.485871901999985 ], [ -83.907147259999988, 40.479702667000026 ], [ -83.899165005999976, 40.477319689000012 ], [ -83.89077826, 40.477079216999982 ], [ -83.885328011000013, 40.477340369999979 ], [ -83.871895509000012, 40.47554492 ], [ -83.860952096, 40.474532919000012 ], [ -83.848283867000021, 40.472660957000016 ], [ -83.834405752, 40.467297197999983 ], [ -83.812921624000012, 40.459339913 ], [ -83.797214608, 40.454507117 ], [ -83.756814809, 40.444700298999976 ], [ -83.734927984000024, 40.440258396 ], [ -83.712869496999986, 40.436208170999976 ], [ -83.681884618000026, 40.431439044 ], [ -83.664718479999976, 40.428041651 ], [ -83.656307073, 40.425624170999981 ], [ -83.637397866000015, 40.415244099 ], [ -83.619802574, 40.404133928000022 ], [ -83.608301262, 40.39825133 ], [ -83.600619415999972, 40.395767412 ], [ -83.591778854999973, 40.393218032 ] ] } },

As it moved through Rural Randolph county it bent or snapped numerous utility poles along State Road 32. Also, a large blade on one of the wind turbines in the area was badly damaged.\nAs the tornado entered Winchester, it severely damaged many homes and snapped and uprooted trees in a west-to-east path through Winchester. There was clear evidence of the tornado`s rotational circulation, with uprooted trees pointed to the east on the immediate south side of the tornado, and to the northwest on the immediate north side of the tornado. The damage pattern also indicated the possibility of small multiple vortices rotating around the main vortex. In the residential core of the town, the maximum intensity of the tornado was estimated around 130 mph or high-end EF2 strength.\nThe greatest damage in Winchester occurred on the east side of town at the Taco Bell, as the anchored building was destroyed, as was a church immediately east of the restaurant. In this concentrated area, the NWS Team estimated maximum winds of 155-165 mph, or high- end EF3 damage. Maximum path width in Winchester was estimated at up to 0.4 mile or 700 yards.\nFarther east across more rural eastern Randolph County, a few structures had significant damage, debris was blown in fields, many trees were snapped, and a silo was damaged, all indicative of EF2 maximum damage in the 115-125 mph range.\nThe tornado continued to the Indiana-Ohio state line, with less intense damage primarily to trees before crossing into Ohio. The tornado developed at 1850EST in Randolph County, Indiana, just south of Farmland. The tornado traveled east across Randolph County and entered Darke County, Ohio, at 1920EST, about 2.5 miles west-southwest of Hill Grove.\nAs the tornado moved east across Darke County, it produced EF-1 damage at several locations, with winds estimated to be as high as 110 MPH. Some of the roads with the greatest impact in Darke County were Fisher Dangler Road, Fox Road, and Horatio Harris Creek Road. Several homes had partial roof removal, with debris scattered into tree lines and across adjacent fields. Two injuries were reported in Greenville Township.\nThe tornado entered Miami County at 1952EST as it crossed State Route 721, just north of Grandview Drive. The tornado ended along State Route 48, near the intersection with Klinger Road at 2000EST. The tornado developed at 1850EST in Randolph County, Indiana, just south of Farmland. The tornado traveled east across Randolph County, Indiana, and Darke County, Ohio, and entered Miami County at 1952EST, along State Route 721, just north of Grandview Drive. The tornado reached EF-2 intensity with winds of up to 120 mph near the intersection of Klinger and Rangeline Roads. Two homes had a significant amount of roof and some external wall removal while other nearby properties had outbuildings that were severely damaged.\nThe last damage was noted along State Route 48 near the intersection with Klinger Road.

Peak winds were estimated to be at 110 miles per hour, with a peak width in this segment of the track of 75 yards, and an estimated average width of 50 yards. This tornado continued into Douglas County where it caused EF-2 damage at Eppley Airfield, then moved back into Pottawattamie County shortly after. This is a continuation of the first Pottawattamie County segment of this EF-3 tornado. In the prior segment, this tornado produced EF-0 and EF-1 damage to a neighborhood in western Council Bluffs, Iowa. This tornado crossed the Missouri River into Douglas County at the start of this segment of its track. This is where the first video evidence of a complete funnel in contact with the ground occurred. This video was taken at the Eppley Airport as the tornado did damage on the southeast side of the Eppley Airfield runway system. The tornado destroyed several aircraft hangars and flipped several untethered executive aircraft, producing EF-2 damage. The tornado continued northeast where it crossed the Missouri River for a second time and moved back into Pottawattamie County. Peak winds during this segment of the tornado track were estimated at 118 miles per hour. The maximum width while the tornado was in Douglas County was measured at 200 yards, with an average width during this track segment estimated at 100 yards. This is a continuation of the Douglas County segment of this EF-3 tornado. This is also the second time the tornado moved through portions of western Pottawattamie County. At the start of this segment, the tornado moved northeast across the Missouri River and crossed Interstate 29 near mile marker 58. It widened to about one-quarter mile, damaging numerous homes and businesses between the interstate and Little Kiln Road. The most intense damage was sustained to a residence along Little Kiln Road due to the collapse of most of the exterior and interior walls except for a few interior rooms. A storm damage survey the following day found this to be EF-3 damage, with peak winds estimated at 152 miles per hour. This damage point was when the tornado was at its strongest. The tornado then continued northeast, moving across Old Lincoln Highway about 1.5 miles south of Crescent. EF-2 damage to several homes occurred due to the major loss of the roof and exterior walls. A vehicle detail shop was also destroyed in this area. The tornado then moved across mainly woodland areas before impacting a home and farm outbuildings near the intersection of Badger and Jefferson Avenues, where EF-2 damage was sustained to the home due to major roof damage. After this, the tornado moved across agricultural and woodland areas between 195th Street and Cougar Avenue, producing EF-1 damage to several manufactured homes and farm outbuildings. Further to the northeast, the tornado produced EF-0 damage to farm outbuildings by removing large portions of their roofs and snapping large tree limbs. This tornado weakened near the intersection of 210th Street and Teakwood Road, producing intermittent damage to tree limbs. It crossed Interstate 880 about 7 miles west of the I-29 and I-880 interchange, or about 7 miles southeast of Missouri Valley. Shortly after crossing Interstate 880, the tornado briefly moved into far southern Harrison County where it dissipated half a mile north of the county line just to the east of Overton Avenue. The peak width of the tornado during this segment of its track was measured at 550 yards, with an average width estimated at 300 yards. This is the final segment for the EF-3 tornado that impacted Eppley Airfield and portions of western Pottawattamie County. The tornado crossed into far southern Harrison County less than a quarter mile from the York Road and Overton Avenue intersection. For the short time the tornado was in the county, it produced EF-0 damage to trees along a half-mile stretch of Overton Avenue. The tornado dissipated half a mile north of the county line just to the east of Overton Avenue. The peak width of the tornado in this segment of its track was measured at 75 yards with an average width estimated at 30 yards.

One of these sustained major roof damage while the other home had most external walls collapse while interior walls remained standing. Numerous trees were snapped and a large shed was completely destroyed at this location while a large steel horse trailer was thrown more than a quarter mile. The tornado continued to Cottonwood Road where it damaged a home and an outbuilding.

Tree damage here was substantial as well with numerous snapped trunks. Residents of this home survived by seeking shelter in the basement bathroom, which was one of the few locations in the home not directly impacted by major flying debris. The tornado crossed Elmtree Road and Highway 6, and appears to have been at its widest near Highway 6 where it was approximately 800 yards wide. Another home was damaged near 270th and Hickory Road.

This was confirmed by photo and video evidence of storm spotters. This tornado moved toward the north-northeast, damaging mainly trees, outbuildings and barns as it tracked towards Sumac Road and 330th Street. At this point, according to radar and storm damage indicators, the tornado rapidly intensified. An outbuilding was totally destroyed near Sycamore Road, and the tornado caused extensive tree damage east of 330th Road, south of Minden. The tornado intensified further, and widened to approximately 1200 yards as it impacted the town of Minden. Video and spotter reports indicate that there were multiple vortices within the tornado near Minden and points northeast, and there was evidence of narrow zones of the most intense damage which lines up very well with the multiple vortex tornado concept. In fact, there were damage indicators of EF-1 damage and high-end EF-3 damage within only 100 yards of each other. The most intense damage was on the far east side of Minden. Numerous homes were uninhabitable and several homes were completely destroyed. There were also several sizeable metal buildings southeast of Main Street that were completely destroyed. The construction of these metal structures and the homes that were most impacted, in conjunction with the tree damage and damage to cars with few if any cars being lofted and thrown indicated that this was a very strong EF-3 tornado, near the top of the damage range for an EF-3. The damage to the town of Minden was extensive, with three injuries. A fourth person succumbed to their injuries after the event, resulting in the only direct fatality of this tornado outbreak in the OAX area. The tornado continued northeast of Minden where it produced EF-3 damage at two homes along 345th Street. One of the homes was somewhat intact but was removed from its foundation and slid approximately 10 yards to the northeast. The other home had only small interior rooms remaining. It is worth noting that these two homes were 700 yards apart along the north-south street. EF-2 damage occurred along Whippoorwill Road. The tornado crossed Interstate 80 near 355th Street, flipping a semi, and produced damage of a mile wide along York Road just north of Interstate 80. This tornado continued briefly into Harrison County and then into Shelby County. EF-1 damage was noted in Harrison County and EF-3 damage was found in Shelby County 2 miles west of Harlan, Iowa. Peak estimated winds in Pottawattamie County from this tornado were estimated at 160 miles per hour. Maximum width was estimated at 1900 yards, with an average width of 850 yards. This is a continuation of the Minden, Iowa EF-3 tornado. This tornado briefly crossed into the far southeast corner of Harrison County. The tornado entered the county on York Road between the county line and Yates Avenue. It was less than a mile before the tornado crossed into Shelby County between York Road and 335th Street. Along York Road, EF-1 damage was noted with several tree trunks snapped and farm outbuildings with exterior walls collapsed. The peak winds in this segment of the tornado track were estimated at 97 miles per hour, with a peak width measured at 1000 yards and an average width also at 1000 yards. This is a continuation of the Minden, Iowa EF-3 tornado. Prior to this segment, the tornado had tracked through Pottawattamie County and a small portion of extreme southeast Harrison County. After crossing into Shelby County between York Road and 335th Street, tree and powerline damage continued to the northeast, with a home having its roof blown off near County Road M16 and 450th Street. Trees in the area were uprooted or snapped at the base of the trunk. A home was badly damaged, and a barn was destroyed less than one mile southeast of Tennant. The tornado appears to have been widest near 750th Street and Hackberry Road, at approximately 1900 yards in width based on tree and powerline damage. At Highway 44, a home was destroyed along with substantial tree damage. Most walls of the home were standing, but a large automobile was thrown or rolled nearly a quarter mile. The tree and vehicle damage suggested that this location was a stronger section of the tornado, and was subsequently rated EF-3. The tornado tracked approximately 1.5 miles northwest of Harlan and began to turn more towards the north, significantly damaging at least 3 homes near Highway 59 as it crossed. It turned almost due north and traveled several miles along Linden Road, and missed the town of Defiance, Iowa by less than half a mile to the east. A second tornado developed just to the east of this one at this time, tracking along Oak Road and causing separate damage. Near Defiance the tornado also became rain-wrapped according to chaser video, and appears likely to have ended just south of the Crawford-Shelby county line. There is some potential based on radar data that this tornado tracked farther north into Crawford County, but damage surveys did not identify a track continuation. The peak estimated winds in this segment of the tornado track were 140 miles per hour. The maximum width of the tornado was measured at 1900 yards with an average width estimated at 1300 yards.", "f_scale": 3, "wind": 160, "source": "NWS Storm Survey", "state_1": "IA", "state_2": null, "state_3": null, "spc_id": null, "ncei_id": "1167525, 1167526, 1167528", "tornado_type": "Tornado", "storm_morphology": "Classic supercell", "sub_morphology": "RM cell in cluster", "satellite_scar": true, "tds": true, "tropical_cyclone": false, "last_certified": "2024-08-07T07:31:02", "satellite needs review": false, "storm_motion": 30, "storm_direction": 213, "vrot": 82, "nrot": 3.26, "meso_diameter": 0.83, "arl": 4155, "radar_distance": 47.49, "radar": "KOAX", "morphology_confidence_high": true, "tds_confidence_high": true, "satellite_scar_degree": "moderate", "radar_scan_time": "2024-04-26T23:04:16" }, "geometry": { "type": "LineString", "coordinates": [ [ -95.617104287000018, 41.322093685000027 ], [ -95.604744668000023, 41.358181102 ], [ -95.587921853000012, 41.397854161999987 ], [ -95.572472329, 41.416651768 ], [ -95.559082741, 41.430810756000028 ], [ -95.549469703999989, 41.452944075 ], [ -95.541573281000012, 41.464522455 ], [ -95.525437110999974, 41.483300762 ], [ -95.507241005000026, 41.502587878999975 ], [ -95.481835122, 41.527524031999974 ], [ -95.44921946, 41.557588878 ], [ -95.430680031, 41.580449355999974 ], [ -95.417633766999984, 41.599707524 ], [ -95.398064369999986, 41.63127848 ], [ -95.381584878000012, 41.655908489000012 ], [ -95.359955544, 41.677452024 ], [ -95.349655860999974, 41.698475663000011 ], [ -95.340729469999985, 41.720517464000011 ], [ -95.33293642000001, 41.74285573100002 ], [ -95.329846515999975, 41.767443050999987 ], [ -95.330189838000024, 41.793556758000022 ], [ -95.331219807000025, 41.808400985999981 ], [ -95.330876483999987, 41.81940397 ], [ -95.330395644000021, 41.836136802999988 ], [ -95.330738966000013, 41.858387054 ] ] } },

Most of the damage west of Holdenville was between Spaulding Road and County Road N369 missing the most populated part of Holdenville to the west and the missing the Davis Correctional Facility to the east. The tornado continued producing roof damage to homes as well as damage to outbuildings, metal buildings, trees and power poles.\nThe tornado was still about one mile in width as it moved north-northeast crossing US Highway 270 and County Road E132, but the intensity increased from EF1 to EF3 as it approached County Road E131. Multiple mobile homes were completely destroyed in this area. Two fatalities occurred in mobile homes here where a 35 year old man was killed in one mobile home and a 4 month old girl was killed in another.\nAlthough the tornado moved through less densely populated areas of Hughes County continued moving north-northeast through less densely populated areas of Hughes County, it still produced significant roof damage to homes and destroyed mobile homes as it continued moving north-northeast, especially along State Highway 48 north of Holdenville, County Road E125 just east of State Highway 48, and E120 Road where EF2 damage was observed in each of these areas.

The tornado continued between County Roads 425 and 322, producing minor damage to the roof of a small farm building. The tornado then overturned a camper along County Road 422 requiring hospitalization including one experiencing blunt force trauma and another being a pregnant female. Five others with minor injuries were treated on the scene. Also at this location, a well-built home was partially destroyed. A mobile home was moved off its foundation here as well, with a third of the roof of a hay barn and a horse trailer destroyed. Projectiles were found in the field across the street from this home, with 2x4s impaled a foot to 18 in the ground at this location. Further south and east along State Road 40, large 100+ year old oak trees that were 4-5 foot in diameter were blown down onto a house, collapsing two exterior walls. Windows were sucked out at this location as well prior to the trees falling when the tornado passed just north of the house. Up the street, a well-built home sustained major damage when the tornado ripped the garage off of the house and sheared it to the north and east into the rest of the dwelling. EF-2 wind speeds of 135 mph were noted at this location.\nWidespread fallen trees south of State Road 40 were noted and surveyors found damage indicators and degrees of damage consistent with EF-3 (140 mph) tornado damage. The tornado was the strongest and widest at this point along the path, at 880 yards or around 1/2 mile. Along County Road 125, a well built shop building was completely destroyed. The metal building structure was well-anchored with H-beams anchored with large bolts and plates at the bases to the foundation. The bolts were snapped and severely bent, along with the plates. On one corner, a large 4-5 foot section of the foundation was ripped off the ground and strewn about 10 feet away with the column anchoring still intact. A 20,000 pound 18-wheeler cab was tossed more than 150 yards into the field across County Road 125. Other nearby semi-trailers that were parked on the property were strewn in the same direction as well, though most were shifted 50-100 feet. The tornado then proceeded into DeKalb County. A tornado continued to track from Jackson into DeKalb County, snapping and uprooting softwood trees over the relatively rural landscape along Melton Drive and Elliot Road. Further east and southeast, the tornado moved across the intersection of Culver, Keith, and Lacey Roads, snapping and uprooting more softwood trees. The tornado crossed State Road 40, peeling back tin on several chicken houses between State Road 40 and Valley Road, causing the structural integrity of one of the houses to be compromised. Additional softwood trees were uprooted and snapped near the intersection of County Roads 714 and 120 along State Road 40 as well, with the loss of several roof panels to a shed structure at a house located here. A large oak tree fell onto a house on County Road 665 at 670. The tornado skipped along uprooting and snapping more hard and softwood trees before lifting near the intersection of County Road 611 and State Road 40.", "f_scale": 3, "wind": 140, "source": "NWS Storm Survey", "state_1": "AL", "state_2": null, "state_3": null, "spc_id": null, "ncei_id": "1181624, 1181626", "tornado_type": "Tornado", "storm_morphology": "Classic supercell", "sub_morphology": "RM discrete cell", "satellite_scar": true, "tds": true, "tropical_cyclone": false, "last_certified": "2025-01-05T16:57:50", "satellite needs review": false, "storm_motion": 23, "storm_direction": 295, "vrot": 70, "nrot": 2.27, "meso_diameter": 0.9, "arl": 1685, "radar_distance": 23.52, "radar": "KHTX", "morphology_confidence_high": true, "tds_confidence_high": true, "satellite_scar_degree": "moderate", "radar_scan_time": "2024-05-09T04:06:01" }, "geometry": { "type": "LineString", "coordinates": [ [ -85.857796399, 34.640690955000025 ], [ -85.84148855799998, 34.636821119 ], [ -85.824803081000027, 34.630239169 ], [ -85.791378321000025, 34.619093016000022 ], [ -85.762195887000019, 34.610616489999984 ], [ -85.735245051, 34.610051356999975 ], [ -85.720138850000012, 34.605671449 ], [ -85.682201685999985, 34.604258527000013 ], [ -85.666325294999979, 34.600515003 ], [ -85.649742810000021, 34.599808500999984 ] ] } },

At the time of tornadogenesis, sheet metal from a farm on the north side of 130th Street was strewn into a nearby field. The tornado then tracked northeast across mainly open fields, breaking off tree branches and snapping tree trunks. There was one farm outbuilding on M Avenue that was completely destroyed by the tornado. This tornado continued into Montgomery and Adams Counties, where it caused EF-2 and EF-3 damage respectively. The peak estimated winds for the Page County segment of this track were 110 miles per hour. This is a continuation of the Adams County EF-3 tornado as it came out of Page County. This tornado crossed into southern Montgomery County just east of the Montgomery-Page Street and O Avenue intersection. As the tornado continued to the northeast, it tracked through several homesteads snapping tree trunks and destroying multiple farm outbuildings. As the tornado crossed 250th Street, a radio tower was destroyed resulting in EF-2 damage. Further to the northwest at a homestead at the intersection of 240th Street and T Avenue, a home took a direct hit with the majority of its roof blown off in addition to the loss of several exterior walls on the second floor. Trees on the property were uprooted and farm outbuilding were completely destroyed and swept away. This is the strongest damage from this tornado in Montgomery County, rated EF-2 with estimated wind speeds of 130 mph. The tornado then crossed US Highway 71 three-quarters of a mile south of US Highway 34, causing damage to trees and destroying an attached garage to a residence. The walls of the garage were bolted to the foundation and had been completely swept away. The remaining house had significant roof damage, but all the walls remained. Afterwards, the tornado crossed US Highway 34 on the south side of the Hacklebarney Woods County Park. Here trees were snapped, small outbuildings were destroyed and a camping trailer was rolled on its side. The tornado then continued northeast, causing damage to outbuildings and snapping tree trunks as it crossed Vine Avenue. The tornado then crossed into Adams County (see Des Moines National Weather Service StormData) approximately two-thirds of a mile north of 210th Street. The tornado entered into Adams County from Montgomery County. This tornado remained in rural areas of western and northern Adams County until lifting north of the town of Carl near the Adair County line. The tornado impacted a house on the north side of 200th street shortly after entering the county removing much of the roof with general collapse of the structure. A large hog confinement facility near the intersection of 190th and Aspen was severally damage with most buildings destroyed. EF3 damage occurred to a house along 175th Street near Cherry Avenue with all wall removed except a couple of the interior walls. The outbuildings at this location were all destroyed as well. Another house along 150th Street near Dogwood Avenue had all but a few interior walls removed with EF3 damage as well. All outbuildings were destroyed at this site as well. The tornado turned slightly to the right at this point with only limited interaction with building sites but plenty of tree damage for the remainder of it path.", "f_scale": 3, "wind": 150, "source": "NWS Storm Survey", "state_1": "IA", "state_2": null, "state_3": null, "spc_id": null, "ncei_id": "1188204, 1188213, 1170282", "tornado_type": "Tornado", "storm_morphology": "Classic supercell", "sub_morphology": "RM cell in cluster", "satellite_scar": true, "tds": true, "tropical_cyclone": false, "last_certified": "2025-03-28T08:37:50", "satellite needs review": false, "storm_motion": 51, "storm_direction": 229, "vrot": 65, "nrot": 1.88, "meso_diameter": 0.76, "arl": 7110, "radar_distance": 69.62, "radar": "KOAX", "morphology_confidence_high": true, "tds_confidence_high": true, "satellite_scar_degree": "strong", "radar_scan_time": "2024-05-21T20:07:04" }, "geometry": { "type": "LineString", "coordinates": [ [ -95.200547976999985, 40.856148497999982 ], [ -95.183381839, 40.85705735 ], [ -95.168103976999987, 40.859913658999972 ], [ -95.156774326, 40.865885545000026 ], [ -95.145616336999979, 40.873544348999985 ], [ -95.111970707000012, 40.893271423999977 ], [ -95.093774601, 40.90300301100001 ], [ -95.077810092999982, 40.912343987999975 ], [ -95.055837436, 40.922980715999984 ], [ -95.044164463000016, 40.929465686000015 ], [ -95.032834811999976, 40.936209379 ], [ -95.020990176999987, 40.94424903700002 ], [ -95.015325351, 40.947879528999977 ], [ -95.010347170999978, 40.951120872 ], [ -94.998674198, 40.958640173 ], [ -94.995755954, 40.960843943999976 ], [ -94.99146442, 40.963695773999973 ], [ -94.984941288000016, 40.967973287 ], [ -94.955415531000028, 40.99155944 ], [ -94.933442875000026, 41.006847054 ], [ -94.927523512999983, 41.010859628 ], [ -94.921992562000014, 41.015643028999989 ], [ -94.914259214000026, 41.02357420200002 ], [ -94.910418758, 41.027299920000019 ], [ -94.906510196, 41.030842446 ], [ -94.89950380099998, 41.036128960999974 ], [ -94.892292540000028, 41.041331191999973 ], [ -94.884784218999982, 41.046217214000023 ], [ -94.881304428000021, 41.048996527999975 ], [ -94.877867128999981, 41.051714606000019 ], [ -94.873034361, 41.057030885000017 ], [ -94.868383213000016, 41.06252615 ], [ -94.861681513, 41.069630824 ], [ -94.858600938999984, 41.073285360999989 ], [ -94.855680270999983, 41.07702088100001 ], [ -94.850722242000018, 41.083311788 ], [ -94.845279456000014, 41.089536306000014 ], [ -94.832888116, 41.102039811999987 ], [ -94.829178738999985, 41.105100644 ], [ -94.825042075999988, 41.107563829000014 ], [ -94.816541476999987, 41.111691730000018 ], [ -94.805058448000011, 41.117937144999985 ], [ -94.798091235000015, 41.121449841000015 ], [ -94.790900116999978, 41.124765576000016 ], [ -94.777574344000016, 41.129537492999987 ], [ -94.771420283, 41.132459005999976 ], [ -94.768169988000011, 41.134114263000015 ], [ -94.764779675999989, 41.135383267 ], [ -94.762617112999976, 41.13640913 ], [ -94.76029409, 41.137361907000013 ], [ -94.757870304999983, 41.138195220999989 ], [ -94.755412938, 41.138872546000016 ], [ -94.744835235999972, 41.141203779000023 ], [ -94.735522530000026, 41.143296303 ], [ -94.731494085, 41.144064905999983 ], [ -94.727502958, 41.144951531 ], [ -94.706015431000026, 41.150367964999987 ], [ -94.699707961, 41.151924709000014 ], [ -94.696535024000013, 41.152568875999975 ], [ -94.693035556999973, 41.153207415999987 ], [ -94.691216321000013, 41.153514742000027 ], [ -94.69030436700001, 41.153779568 ], [ -94.689326178999977, 41.154077759000018 ], [ -94.687783652, 41.154697182 ] ] } },

The tornado was ongoing for about an hour and a half with a total path length just under 48 miles. The tornado was the strongest in Cooke County and resulted in 7 fatalities in Cooke County.\nIn Montague County, the tornado began near Roth Rd and Body Rd, approximately 5 miles southeast of Bowie, impacting trees and isolated outbuildings. The tornado moved eastward, damaging multiple rural residences in south central Montague. Two residences, in particular, sustained damage consistent with EF-2 intensity tornadic winds of 120 to 125 mph (DI 2, DOD 6). This tornado continued eastward, tracking south through southeast of the Forestburg community. Widespread tree and outbuilding damage was observed across southeast Montague County, consistent with high end EF-0 to mid range EF-1 damage (winds 75 to 110 mph). Minor structural damage was also sustained to several residences in the areas south through southeast of Forestburg. The tornado exited Montague County at 1008 pm CDT time, just west of Rosston between Seldom Seen Rd and Cooke Co Rd 345. The estimated track length for this portion of the tornado was 15.4 miles, and the maximum width was 1400 yards as the tornado was exiting the county. The highest damage rating in Montague County was EF-2 with winds of maximum estimated winds of 120-125 mph. This is segment #2 of 4 of a multi-segmented EF-3 supercellular tornado that began in Montague County, crossed into Cooke County, Denton County, and then back into Cooke County. The tornado was ongoing for about an hour and a half with a total path length just under 48 miles. The tornado was the strongest in Cooke County and resulted in 7 fatalities in Cooke County.\nThe tornado entered Cooke County at 1008 pm CDT time and exited into Denton County at 1049 pm CDT for a total path length of 25.41 miles. The tornado path zigzagged at times. The maximum width of the damage path is measured at over a mile in the area west of Valley View; however this is misleading. We do not believe the tornado was over a mile wide, but instead there were a few smaller circulations rotating around the main tornado circulation which was likely a maximum width of about 1200 yards (.68 miles wide). The tornado entered west of the Rosston area and moved eastward to areas south of Era. Widespread tree damage, consistent with EF-0 tornado intensities, occurred between Rosston to southwest of Era. In the vicinity of FM 51 south of Era, the intensity of damage increased, with widespread tree and structural damage consistent with EF-1 winds of 90-110 mph . Some damage to at least 3 residences southeast of Era (and west of Valley View) was consistent with EF-2 tornadic winds of 115-125 mph (DI 2, DOD 6).The tornado maintained intensity as it approached Valley View from the west. Along CR 200, the upper levels and roofs of several newly constructed homes were damaged or demolished. In addition, a few walls were pushed in on the backside of the homes (west side, DI 2, DOD 6) In this area, the tornado was rated EF-3 with maximum estimated winds of 140 mph. The tornado entered a neighborhood along W Lone Oak Rd which consisted of mainly manufactured and mobile homes. Widespread damage occurred in this neighborhood, and a few demolished homes were rated EF-2 (DI 3, DOD 6). Unfortunately, 7 fatalities occurred here, too. The tornado continued east, crossing I-35, damaging cars and tractor trailers on the interstate. The tornado hit a gas station (DI 8, DOD 7), metal building shop, RV and boat storage units on the corner of Lone Oak Rd and I-35. This area was rated EF-2 with estimated winds of 135 mph. The tornado tracked near and south of E Lone Oak Rd towards Ray Roberts Lake where more roof damage and notable tree damage was observed. The tornado crossed the lake, causing more tree damage and pushing over some campers on the peninsula that includes Ray Roberts Lake State Park Johnson Branch. This is where the tornado entered Denton County. In total, 80 people in Cooke County had to be transported due to injuries. There were likely more that sustained minor injures that weren't transported or accounted for. The highest damage rating in this portion of Cooke County was EF-3 with maximum sustained winds of 140 mph. This is segment #3 of 4 of a multi-segmented EF-3 supercellular tornado that began in Montague County, crossed into Cooke County, Denton County, and then back into Cooke County. The tornado was ongoing for about an hour and a half with a total path length just under 48 miles. The tornado was the strongest in Cooke County and resulted in 7 fatalities in Cooke County.\nThe tornado entered Denton County at 1049 pm CDT time and exited into Cooke County at 1106 pm CDT for a total path length of 4.34 miles. The tornado was initially moving east but then started curving north as it entered its dissipation stage. The tornado entered the county on the the peninsula that includes Ray Roberts Lake State Park Johnson Branch. On the peninsula the tornado caused tree damage and pushed over some campers. The tornado then moved back over the lake and crossed back into Cooke County before dissipating. During this segment of the tornado, it was rated EF-1 with maximum estimated winds of 100 mph. This is the final segment (#4) of a multi-segmented EF-3 supercellular tornado that began in Montague County, crossed into Cooke County, Denton County, and then back into Cooke County. The tornado was ongoing for about an hour and a half with a total path length just under 48 miles. The tornado was the strongest in Cooke County and resulted in 7 fatalities in Cooke County.\nThe tornado reentered Cooke County at 1106 pm CDT while over Ray Roberts Lake. Additional tree damage was found near the end of Anderson Road in Pilot Point (DI 27, DOD 3). The tornado was moving into its occlusion phase at this point and likely dissipated over the lake north of this point. The tornado was rated EF-1 strength along this segment of the tornado with maximum estimated winds of 100 mph.", "f_scale": 3, "wind": 140, "source": "NWS Storm Survey", "state_1": "TX", "state_2":

Another business building behind the storage units only sustained damage to glass windows and a broken garage door. Just to the south of the storage complex, another large metal building with multiple bay doors facing the prevailing tornado forward speed winds was badly damaged, with most walls collapsed. The tornado kept moving east, expanding in width, and snapping trees and power poles along Maxie Camp Road. As the tornado approached the intersection of Maxie Camp and Starkey Road, a mobile home was completely lofted and destroyed. Extensive tree damage was observed all along the north-south portion of Maxie Camp Road. A couple homes, one with a CMU footprint and the other with a partial concrete pad and open crawlspace concrete footing were completely lifted off of their bases and destroyed, with below code anchoring methods found on both of these homes. Trees in the immediate vicinity of the destroyed homes were snapped, and a large pickup truck was rolled onto its roof. This was the location of the worst observed structural damage, consistent with EF3 wind speeds of up to 145 mph. A resident of one of the destroyed homes sustained non- life-threatening injuries. The tornado then started to move due northeast, paralleling US Highway 62, moving just southeast of Olvey, and causing mainly tree damage and damaging small outbuildings. Boone County Sheriff's Department reported one fatality in Boone County inside a destroyed mobile home, near the Olvey area. This tornado then exited Boone County and entered Marion County. The Boone-Marion County tornado continued into Marion County from Boone County, paralleling just south of US Highway 62, near Pyatt. Marion County EM reported three fatalities from this tornado. Extensive tree damage was observed across several county roads, and a few mobile homes were tossed and destroyed on Marion County Road 4010. After crossing Marion County Road 4010, the tornado path width increased to its widest point, and likely maintained a maximum path width of around 2000 yards for a few miles, via satellite imagery, as it moved through the Crooked Creek Valley. Extensive tree damage was observed along and around Crooked Creek, and moderate damage to the second level of a tin home was found as well. The tornado kept moving northeast, snapping most trees in its path as it crossed Crooked Creek multiple times and eventually, Marion County Road 4006, where it moved over the Snow Access Campground Area. The tornado then crossed US Highway 62 again near the small municipality of Snow, causing minor to moderate damage to a few homes around the area. As the tornado crossed US Highway 62, the path width began to decrease, and it began moving more eastward. Mainly tree damage was observed to the north of US Highway 62, and eventually it crossed State Highway 125, and Marion County Road 3032, where more extensive tree damage was observed, and another mobile home, which was untethered, was lofted and completely destroyed. The tornado continued to move east-northeast, causing mostly tree damage, before eventually dissipating to the northwest of Summit. This tornado tracked across two counties and was rated an EF3 with maximum estimated wind speeds of up to 145 mph.", "f_scale": 3, "wind": 145, "source": "NWS Storm Survey", "state_1": "AR", "state_2": null, "state_3": null, "spc_id": null, "ncei_id": "1181735, 1181746", "tornado_type": "Tornado", "storm_morphology": "Classic supercell", "sub_morphology": "RM cell in cluster", "satellite_scar": true, "tds": true, "tropical_cyclone": false, "last_certified": "2025-03-20T18:13:31", "satellite needs review": false, "storm_motion": 36, "storm_direction": 267, "vrot": 76, "nrot": 2.11, "meso_diameter": 1.12, "arl": 4110, "radar_distance": 65.89, "radar": "KSGF", "morphology_confidence_high": true, "tds_confidence_high": true, "satellite_scar_degree": "strong", "radar_scan_time": "2024-05-26T08:54:21" }, "geometry": { "type": "LineString", "coordinates": [ [ -93.05334846, 36.174543203999974 ], [ -93.040044702999978, 36.178076632 ], [ -93.022449412000014, 36.179219766000017 ], [ -93.005626597, 36.177072045999978 ], [ -92.998245157999975, 36.176656352 ], [ -92.991121211, 36.177418456999987 ], [ -92.982967296000027, 36.17859624099998 ], [ -92.973611751000021, 36.179704727 ], [ -92.965801157999977, 36.182060208999985 ], [ -92.947347560000026, 36.187151963000019 ], [ -92.923057475, 36.192658999 ], [ -92.892330088999984, 36.207204022999974 ], [ -92.868469157, 36.217834032999974 ], [ -92.851303019, 36.225450742000021 ], [ -92.837741771000026, 36.22894725499998 ], [ -92.830531993000022, 36.23033197 ], [ -92.819717325999989, 36.232755161 ], [ -92.808902659000012, 36.237047487999973 ], [ -92.794998088, 36.243693205 ], [ -92.783668437000017, 36.251653477 ], [ -92.777145304999976, 36.254837359000021 ], [ -92.769506373000013, 36.257536635 ], [ -92.759979166999983, 36.260097401 ], [ -92.748306193000019, 36.261273941000013 ], [ -92.738693156000011, 36.263730775999989 ], [ -92.724359430999982, 36.266222135000021 ], [ -92.714488902000028, 36.267260178000015 ], [ -92.694576182, 36.269751424999981 ], [ -92.686508098, 36.271273813999983 ] ] } },

The tornado continued across AR Hwy 14 to Marion County Road 6014 and 6011 where it caused minor roof damage to some homes and continued to snap and uproot trees. On Backway Road, a double- wide shifted off its foundation a few feet and had a large tree fall on it. Across the street, an outbuilding sustained damage to the roof and flooring. The tornado continued towards Hand Mountain where the path width increased significantly to in excess of 1000 yards, snapping and uprooting numerous trees, and then crossed the White River into Baxter County, followed by Fulton County. The Briarcliff Tornado continued in Baxter County from Marion County and moved through a small residential area along the White River, pulling siding and shingles off houses in addition to causing significant tree damage. The tornado continued eastward, further expanding in width, and reached a maximum width of up to 1 mile wide, crossing mostly rural areas and causing significant tree damage, passing across Wild Hog Mountain, and crossing Shipps Ferry Road and Round Rock Trail. As it approached the Arkana and Norfork Village area, the path width contracted slightly, and large swaths of trees were found uprooted and snapped as it crossed the White River briefly once again north of Hwy 341 at Riverside Dr. The tornado continued northeast towards Briarcliff, where mostly tree damage was observed to the west of Highway 5. As the tornado crossed the highway, widespread tree damage became prevalent, with most trees snapped at their trunks. A few structures were severely damaged, including a home, and a metal shop building. The tornado also impacted a local RV/trailer camping park, where five fifth-wheel recreation trailers were tossed and completely destroyed. One fatality was reported out of this area as well. The tornado also moved over a 350 kV transmission line that intersected Hwy 5, snapping several wooden two-poled line towers, and bending two steel two-poled line towers to the ground, indicative of EF2 wind speeds. After crossing Hwy 5, the tornado moved into the Briarcliff residential area, encountering significant topography. 17 injuries were reported within the Briarcliff community. The tornado path width expanded again, reaching a width of up to 1 mile wide for a short duration as it moved through Briarcliff. Significant tree damage was observed over a large portion of the roads in the area, and via satellite imagery. A few homes sustained moderate damage, likely exacerbated by debris and projectiles. The Briarcliff City Hall building, which sat on top of a hill on Scenic Drive, sustained significant structural damage, with most of the second level of the building destroyed, indicative of EF3 wind speeds of up to 140 mph. The tornado then continued to move northeast, moving over several hills on the east side of Briarcliff. A two- story home located off of the Shoal Creek tributary sustained significant roof damage with most of the structure pulled off to the wall plates, and all the surrounding trees to the east uprooted from the road to the waterline. The tornado then crossed the lake, and struck a few peninsulas, where more significant tree damage was observed. After crossing Norfork Lake, the tornado continued northeast on the north side of the lake, moving over mostly rural areas, eventually crossing over the Holiday Hills Resort Area on Baxter County Road 149. A few buildings sustained minor roof damage, and a smaller cabin building had the roof structure pulled off with a few exterior walls collapsed. Most trees around the resort were uprooted as well. The tornado then kept moving northeast into Fulton County. The Briarcliff Tornado kept moving northeast into Fulton County from Baxter County, decreasing in width, and moved primarily over rural areas, causing only tree damage, and eventually dissipating just west of Elizabeth Road near Center Point Loop.

The first observed property damage attributable to this tornado was in the Sarasota Colony neighborhood of Lakeport where the tornado demolished the second story dwellings of three well-built homes and then proceeded to cross Florida State Road 78 into the Fishermans Lane neighborhood where it destroyed the roofs and broke windows of 1920s-era Florida homes, lofted and tossed several manufactured homes and travel trailers, flipped a Ford Focus station wagon, and deposited debris over two blocks from their original location into the bottom of a retention pond behind the neighborhood. One manufactured home chassis was observed wrapped 15 to 20 feet above the ground around a hardwood tree located across the street from its original location with the contents of the home located in the pond almost 200 yards downstream. Damage from multiple vortices was observed at this location including one swath that reached EF-1 intensity to the east of the main EF-3 damage path. The tornado proceeded north-northwest to the east of the Harney Pond Canal into the Brighton Seminole Indian Reservation. A tornadic debris signature was detectable on the Miami radar at 1:48 PM EST as the tornado entered the southern limits of the reservation. As the tornado continued north-northwest, it damaged trees and pulled metal panels from roofing of assorted outbuildings from different homesteads on the south side of the reservation. The tornado entered the Brighton Seminole Village causing tree and chickee hut roof damage in the Knotts Landing neighborhood before moving into the Sports Complex where it demolished the spectator and dugout areas of some of the baseball fields. The tornado likely lifted behind one of the baseball fields around 1:49 PM EST. The Miami radar continue to detect a tornadic debris signature through 1:50 PM EST as the storm moved north along Reservation Road. The tornado was rated as a violent EF-3 that at peak produced an estimated 140 mph wind in the Sarasota Colony neighborhood of Glades County.

The tornado moved north-northeast, eventually affecting several western Palm Beach County communities. A National Weather Service survey identified the southernmost surveyed point in the Rustic Ranches section of Wellington where a double-wide mobile home on Deer Path Lane was left practically unrecognizable, rated as an EF-3 at this location with 7 injuries reported. The tornado tracked north-northeast over the far western portion of Wellington, across the Lakefield West, Meadowwood, and Binks Forest communities, where EF-1 and EF-2 damage was noted to homes and trees. The tornado crossed Southern Boulevard/US Highway 98, then continued north-northeast across Loxahatchee Groves and The Acreage where EF-1 to isolated EF-2 damage was observed to homes, trees, and outbuildings. The tornado intensified as it approached Northlake Boulevard on the north end of The Acreage, then did its most considerable damage in the Avenir community of Palm Beach Gardens. At the beginning of this community, a large portion of the roof collapsed of a Publix supermarket building which was recently completed and set to open in the near future, and rated EF-3. Considerable structural damage rated EF-2 and EF-3, including heavy roof damage, impact-resistant windows which were shattered and blown in, and vehicles lifted and moved at least 100 yards were observed. The tornado then moved just west but very close to North Palm Beach County General Aviation Airport, where a wind gust of 92 mph from the south-southwest was measured at the AWOS around 4:10 PM EST. The tornado crossed Bee Line Highway/SR 710 where tree damage was observed, then entered Jupiter Farms where EF-1 to EF-2 damage was noted to trees, outbuildings, and power poles. Footage from a Florida Turnpike highway camera showed the tornado moving north past Jupiter Farms to the Martin County line, where it continued north for a short distance. The tornado was rated a EF-3 with a path width of 200-300 yards for much of the track, with only a few places where the circulation may have briefly lifted. There were 15 structures destroyed, and 321 with minor to major damage with a total of $81.35 million in damage. Using a combination of reports from Martin County Emergency Management and radar dual polarimetric data, the National Weather Service in Melbourne can confirm that a tornado moved northward out of Jupiter (Palm Beach County) and into far southern Martin County. This is associated with the Palm Beach Gardens tornado that was recorded by the National Weather Service Miami Office.\nRadar data suggests the circulation was weakening as it moved into Martin County before crossing I-95 around Mile Marker 91. A report from Florida Highway Patrol indicated the tornado produced tree damage and flipped a tractor trailer at this location.

The survey determined that the tornado touched down to the south of Midway Rd. in Fort Pierce and continued on a nearly continuous path for approximately 21 miles until it moved offshore into the Atlantic Ocean near Jaycee Park in Indian River County.\nSignificant vegetative and structural damage was observed along nearly the entire path length, indicating the tornado was continuous. Initial structural damage occurred within the Creekside Subdivision and Sunnier Palms Park and Campground along Okeechobee Rd. Here, several homes within the Creekside community suffered partial roof loss, while numerous mobile and manufactured homes within the Sunnier Palms community suffered major damage or were destroyed. Extensive tree damage was also noted in the area.\nThe tornado continued north-northeast over rural portions of St. Lucie County, parallel to S Kings Hwy. Here, the tornado strengthened to EF-3, with peak winds up to 155 mph. Two large warehouses along Orange Ave., one brand new construction, experienced major damage with greater than 50% of the structure collapsed.\nDamage was noted in rural areas adjacent to Kings Hwy as the tornado traveled north, resulting in occasional significant structural damage as well as numerous downed trees and power lines. EF-3 tornado damage occurred one final time at a truss company along Kings Hwy, where greater than 50% of a steel/metal building collapsed. The tornado then intersected subdivisions in the northern part of the county where additional residential damage was observed. Numerous single family homes in both Holiday Pines and Portofino Shores experienced significant roof, soffit, and siding damage, where the tornado likely continued as an EF-2 with peak winds estimated between 110 - 125 mph.\nThe most prolific and extensive damage from the event was noted in the Spanish Lakes community, where a total of six storm-related fatalities were confirmed. Numerous mobile and manufactured homes were destroyed along the western edge of the community, where the tornado produced high-end EF-2 winds of 125 - 135 mph. An initial survey of the community indicates over 20 homes were tossed (some flipped) from their foundation. Despite the extensive damage to the communities' manufactured homes, nearly all concrete block structures in the community experienced relatively minor or moderate damage. The tornado then moved into Indian River County. This tornado is a continuation of the unusually strong tornado that impacted St. Lucie County. The tornado moved out of the Spanish Lakes Subdivision in St. Lucie County where it then entered the Vero Beach Highlands neighborhood in Indian River County, where multiple properties suffered roof and outbuilding damage, and healthy hardwood trees either were toppled or snapped. This damage paralleled a few blocks within 6th Ave SW. Farther north along US-1 in the Oslo area, a Publix suffered broken windows. Roof AC units were dislodged and fell to the ground, and a car was flipped over. This damage is consistent with EF-1 winds of 90 - 110 mph.\nAfter crossing the Indian River, additional damage occurred on the barrier island of Vero Beach, mainly near and west of A1A between Bay Dr and Jaycee Park. Significant damage occurred at the Bayou condominiums, where sections of the roof were torn off both the east and west buildings and thrown northward into a neighboring tree line. A pontoon boat was lifted out of the water and landed upside down on the sea wall. Winds in this small area were likely 115 - 125 mph, or EF-2 strength. Wind magnitudes may have been accentuated by proximity to open water.\nNorth from there, missing shingles or roof tiles were noted on several homes and businesses, consistent with either EF-0 or EF-1 winds. Many large tree branches were broken. In the Bethel Creek neighborhood, multiple homes suffered major roof loss (greater than 50%) and pool cages were destroyed. A low-rise multi-family building also lost over 20% of its roof. The Bethel Creek area damage was EF-2 with winds of 115 - 125 mph. The tornado then continued into a wooded area along the beach, snapping or toppling many trees before moving offshore into the Atlantic Ocean near Jaycee Park where it likely became a waterspout. The waterspout began as a long-track EF-3 tornado that impacted portions of Fort Pierce and Vero Beach. The tornado entered the Indian River as a waterspout east of the intersection of US-1 and Indian River Blvd. After crossing the Indian River, additional damage occurred on the barrier island of Vero Beach, mainly near and west of A1A between Bay Dr and Jaycee Park. Crossing the barrier island, the circulation then moved offshore once again into the Atlantic near Tracking Station Beachfront Park.
