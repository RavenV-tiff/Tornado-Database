The west side of the road sustained the heaviest damage, all to manufactured homes. Only one actual mobile home was flipped and thrown into the fire station. This was noted to be of very degraded construction with only one strap seen. None of the homes surveyed had a sustained load path with strapping. A few were pushed slightly off their foundations with roof damage and undercarriage damage. To the east of Highway1011, these were well-built homes with only tree damage and minor roof/gutter damage. We do believe the tornado was wide enough to cause damage on both sides but the construction was better on theeast side, hence the lower damage. Around the intersections of Highway 1, Highway 1011, and Highway 308, there were trees down, a few pieces of roof pulled off and damage to a thrift store. The concrete blocks at the top were pushed off with significant roof damage. Throughout the track, debris was noted well away from where it came from, with the thrift store's roof both to the eastand to the west. Debris indentations in the ground were widely seen and debris splatter was noted on all sides of the buildings. Also to note, off to the east on Highway 1014, power poles were leaning in one direction with very minor siding damage to a few manufactured homes.

A piece of lumber from the shed was found 60 yards to the south of where the shed originated.\nFor the next 100 yards or so, there was a scattering of aluminum housing trim that came from a pile near an outbuilding, but there was also a path of corn stover and lots of broken limbs from several dead trees in the area. Near the end of this path of light debris, a large dead tree was uprooted and blown to the south. This was the most impressive damage from the tornado with estimated winds of 75 mph.

At the lake, a small boat with an attached motor was flipped within a covered dock on its southwest side and additional downed oak trees and large limbs were observed on its northeast side. The tornado may have briefly lifted as it moved across SC Highway 38 with minimal tree limb damage observed on either side of the highway before it appeared to strengthen again when moving into another property.\nAdditional large limbs were snapped on the southwest side of this property and an old home suffered considerable metal roof panel removal with the panels scattered northwest and west of the home. Minor metal roof damage to a few equipment shelters, a newer barn door which was pushed in enough to break it from its hinges, and several large pecan tree limbs which snapped off were observed on the northwest side of this property. Lastly, young corn crops were nearly flattened and an open two-tier wood fence was blown down and tossed to the northwest just before the tornado crossed Old Highway 38 South. The tornado dissipated just northeast of this road with no additional damage observed at Allen Ridge Road.", "f_scale": 0, "wind": 85, "source": "NWS Storm Survey", "state_1": "SC", "state_2": null, "state_3": null, "spc_id": null, "ncei_id": "1173580", "tornado_type": "Tornado", "storm_morphology": "Mini supercell", "sub_morphology": "RM discrete cell", "satellite_scar": true, "tds": true, "tropical_cyclone": false, "last_certified": "2025-03-21T20:43:35", "satellite_needs_review": false, "storm_motion": 19, "storm_direction": 238, "vrot": 23, "nrot": 0.45, "meso_diameter": 1.22, "arl": 6260, "radar_distance": 65.87, "radar": "KLTX", "morphology_confidence_high": true, "tds_confidence_high": true, "satellite_scar_degree": "weak", "radar_scan_time": "2024-05-14T20:44:40" }, "geometry": { "type": "LineString", "coordinates": [ [ -79.645854629999974, 34.419770056 ], [ -79.643794694, 34.421256912999979 ], [ -79.641477265, 34.422602141000027 ], [ -79.638687768000011, 34.425469529 ], [ -79.631907142999978, 34.43099163 ], [ -79.63061968300002, 34.432619871999975 ], [ -79.629031815000019, 34.433327792999989 ], [ -79.627443947000017, 34.43339858500002 ], [ -79.625898995, 34.434283477 ], [ -79.624611534999985, 34.435380731 ], [ -79.624525704, 34.435593101 ] ] } },

A couple trees fell on the service station, causing some collateral damage. The gas station canopy was not damaged, but a large sign behind the building was snapped.

The post office building sustained some minor structural damage, including uplift of some metal roofing material. An HVAC unit was blown off of the roof of the building.

The tornado touched down about a half mile north-northwest of the Highway 90 and Ferris Fork Road intersection where two large trees were downed, facing back to the southeast. Just downstream of that, a residence was hit and this is where the tornado quickly reached its widest point and strongest winds. Here, several hardwood and softwood trees had large limbs broken or were uprooted. Ground and aerial survey with a drone both confirmed that trees were laying in multiple directions, including in opposite directions of storm motion. There was very little structural damage, an indication that the tornado was struggling to keep in contact with the ground, and likely a contributing factor to the relative weakness of the tornado. Peak winds here were 80 to 85 MPH.\nThe tornadic circulation continued in a generally northerly direction for the next three quarters of a mile, hugging the west side of Cedar Ridge, and just to the east of Ferris Fork Road. At this point, the tornado crossed into extreme southeastern Metcalfe County, where it remained on the ground for about one-half mile before lifting. The tornadic circulation continued from Cumberland County into Metcalfe County, hugging the west side of Cedar Ridge just to the east of Ferris Creek Road and Earl Hurt Road. The tornado lifted about 1.9 miles north-northeast of Dubre at a residence along Earl Hurt Road after uprooting several more trees that were oriented in multiple directions. A drone was flown along the western edge of the ridge line between the initial residence that was impacted and the lifting point, and very little limb damage was noted.

Upon further investigation, more security camera video footage was received from the Neah-Kah-Nie School district showing distinct rotation of a tornado moving through a parking lot where several items were thrown or moved including portions of a baseball dug-out, porta-potty, and several dumpsters. A garage on the premises had its roof blown off and the garage doors blown in. One minor injury was reported.
