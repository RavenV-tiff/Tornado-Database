1156690,Santa Rosa,FL,2024-01-09T08:29,MOB,Original survey and event narrative have this tornado as an EF1 with 105 MPH winds
1151739,Coffee,GA,2024-01-09T17:55,JAX,This entry and Bacon Co. (1154910) are duplicate entries for a tornado that crossed both counties
1149965,Pinellas,FL,2024-01-09T22:23,TBW,Time is incorrect. Should be 21:23Z determined from original survey and radar data
1159309,Craven,NC,2024-01-10T06:03,MHX,Seems like entry time is in UTC. Should be 01:05Z
1159305,Carteret,NC,2024-01-10T07:05,MHX,Seems like entry time is in UTC. Start time should be 02:09Z
1159307,Carteret,NC,2024-01-10T07:05,MHX,"Seems like entry time is in UTC. Start time should be 02:09Z. Also missing another entry across the Straits. EF0 tornado damage surveyed, but removed in Storm Data and not categorized as severe thunderstorm winds or another tornado"
,St. Lucie,FL,2024-01-15T22:37,MLB,Tornado reported and videos received on social media of a tornado on the ground west of I95
,Sonoma,CA,2024-02-01T19:11,MTR,Video shows tornado near Two Rock
1163222,Haskell,TX,2024-02-03T05:12,SJT,Time in entry is in UTC. Start time should be 23:12Z. Additionally storm chaser footage shows the tornado continues roughly 5 miles further NE than what SJT surveyed
,Haskell,TX,2024-02-02T23:31,SJT,Another tornado formed north of the dissipating EF2 tornado as shown on storm chaser videos
1161485,Broward,FL,2024-02-18T20:55,MFL,Track may be backwards?
1155979,Cook,IL,2024-02-28T01:55,LOT,Event entry has the wrong county. Should be Lake
1163626,Calhoun,MI,2024-02-28T05:29,GRR,Original PNS has 1 injury. Unsure if mistake since NCEI narrative states no injuries or fatalities
,Broome,NY,2024-02-28T2220,BGM,EF1 tornado surveyed near Castle Creek
,Umatilla,OR,2024-03-05T19:00,PDT,At least one landspout observed
,Putnam,OH,2024-03-05T19:29,IWX,EF0 landspout tornado surveyed
1163820,Clinch,GA,2024-03-09T17:09,JAX,This segment of the tornado includes information for Ware Co. in segmenent 1164959
1163819,Brantley,GA,2024-03-09T17:39,JAX,Timing of event likely incorrect. Radar indicates the storm passed an hour later or at 18:39Z
1157001,Adams,IN,2024-03-14T22:40,IWX,Track for this segment is backwards
,Breckinridge,KY,2024-03-15T03:32,OHX,EF0 tornado surveyed near Raymond
1167231,Finney,KS,2024-03-24T20:30,DDC,Missing path
,Wilbarger,TX,2024-03-24T22:27,OUN,"Multiple reports of tornado SSW of Grayback. Satellite imagery shows a possible ground mark near 33.858N, -99.168W"
1168223,Pueblo,CO,2024-03-26T23:35,PUB,Time is likely incorrect. Original LSR has a time of 22:35Z and better correlates with a storm in that area on radar. End time is also incorrect if narrative is correct saying it lasted 2 or 3 minutes
1169616,Lincoln,WA,2024-03-27T00:45,OTX,Possible time is incorrect. Original LSR has time at 23:50Z instead
1168058,Fayette,WV,2024-04-02T20:31,RLX,"DAT has one injury, however no details are available and the NCEI entry does not include this injury"
1176061,Clark,IN,2024-04-02T21:31,LMK,Possible overcount of injuries. In NCEI the summed count is 32 between Clark and Jefferson Co. but 22 should be attributed to the tornado
1173927,Acadia,LA,2024-04-10T12:37,LCH,Time may be incorrect. Both DAT and LSR have a time of 12:27Z
1172705,West Feliciana,LA,2024-04-10T07:13,LIX,"There were at one point three tornadoes surveyed near Bains. One was excluded (perhaps by error) that moved through Bains from the SW and a satellite ground mark is evident along that path. This entry is for the hand-off that occurred just east of the tornado that started near Morganza, however the start position of this tornado is at the end of the removed tornado path and not in the correct location of where the DAT survey has the start."
1178254,St. Tammany,LA,2024-04-10T15:01,LIX,"Width of this tornado was 350 yards in the original survey, however even that seems incorrect with the DAT survey EF0 polygon width being over 1,000 yards wide. Perhaps it should be 1,200 yards wide instead?"
1178283,Hancock,MS,2024-04-10T15:23,LIX,Duplicate entry of 1172764
1172197,Mason,KY,2024-04-12T22:41,ILN,Origninally surveyed as a 90 MPH EF1. Narrative also states this
1172021,Henry,IA,2024-04-16T21:34,DVN,Start location is misplaced from the surveyed path. End location of 1172019 also incorrect
,Salt Lake,UT,2024-04-25T17:07,SLC,Landspout tornado reported and confirmed by numerous photos and videos
1177375,Yuma,CO,2024-04-26T00:15,GLD,Possible the time is incorrect. Multiple LSRs of landspouts in the area around 23Z and supported with radar showing the storm well NE of location at event time
1175146,Cheyenne,KS,2024-04-26T02:45,GLD,Incorrect time compared to LSR which is 21:45Z. Supported with radar data. Also another tornado was reported nearby which appears to be separate from this event but missing from Storm Data
1167564,Lancaster,NE,2024-04-26T19:52,OAX,OAX should review the track of this tornado. There are multiple videos confirming and satellite markings that support this was two separate tornadoes with quick handoffs.
1167565,Lancaster,NE,2024-04-26T20:03,OAX,This was the third and final tornado in quick succession. The track should be reviewed as footage confirms and satellite imagery shows a very well defined path south of the surveyed track and near the surveyed end of the Lincoln tornado. No path was found when reviewing satellite along the path the NWS surveyed for this tornado
,Lancaster,NE,2024-04-26T20:06,OAX,"Video shows a brief tornado or persistent funnel, shortly after the previous EF0 tornado and before the next EF1, possibly near 41.0N -96.49W"
1175782,Woodson,KS,2024-04-26T21:39,ICT,This segment of the track has incorrect times. Should be 20Z instead of 21Z
1167385,Allen,KS,2024-04-26T23:02,ICT,This tornado has the incorrect times. LSR is 22Z and no storms are present at 23Z
1165339,Brown,KS,2024-04-27T19:05,TOP,"Not necessarily an error with the entry, however satellite imagery shows a defined path through fields just north of this entry's path. Start: 39.911N, -95.386W End: 39.925N, -95.361W"
1175409,Morgan,MO,2024-04-28T03:29,SGF,Start location is a mile or so SW of the original survey point
1177191,Grimes,TX,2024-04-28T23:25,HGX,Width seems inaccurate at 50 yrds. Damage polygon is 1200 yards at it's widest and original survey width is 100 yards. Not sure how often WFOs follow the width of the DAT polygon
1165426,Trinity,TX,2024-04-29T00:35,HGX,Possible overcount of injuries. Two injuried but one later fatally
