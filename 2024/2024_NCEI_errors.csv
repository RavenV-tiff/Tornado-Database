1203229,Gibson,IN,2024-07-09T21:48:00,PAH,Time appears incorrect. Original LSR has the tornado occurring at 21:37Z instead. This matches the passage of the supercell,
1198973,Valley,MT,2024-07-13T01:30:00,GGW,Time may be off. The mesocyclone of the supercell is 10 miles NW of event location at 01:30Z. The storm passes over area at 02:00Z which would be a more probable time,
1187375,Marshall,IL,2024-07-15T05:10:00,ILX,Time may be incorrect. At 05:10Z the edge of the line is well south and east. The time places the tornado in the trailing stratiform. Better time is 04:45-04:48Z,

Instead the best fit time is 05:33Z and perhaps the NCEI entry time was confused with a cell crossing the coast near Edisto Beach that also produced a tornado,
