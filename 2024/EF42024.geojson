The tornado continued northeast crossing agricultural fields and flipping numerous center pivots, eventually crossing 252nd Street. The tornado caused EF-2 damage as it approached Highway 92, damaging numerous homes and striking an acreage northwest of the Highway 92 (West Center street) and Highway 275 intersection. Several center pivots were overturned as the tornado continued northeast crossing east of Highway 275, causing EF-2 damage to several acreages, homes, and outbuildings along Highway 275/240th Street. Continuing northeast, the tornado crossed 234th Street near Harney Street where it damaged a horse farm and an acreage as well as a home along Dodge Street/Highway 6 before crossing Dodge Street causing roof and outbuilding damage at the Junkstock Farm. The tornado crossed the Elkhorn River, damaging trees and flipping center pivots in an acreage along Blondo Street just south of the railroad tracks. The tornado continued into the western part of Elkhorn approximately one-half mile south-southwest of the intersection of West Maple Road and 216th Street. One home sustained high-end EF-2 damage losing large sections of its roofs. Another home just to the north had total destruction of the structure, resulting in EF-4 damage. The tornado moved across Prospect Hills Cemetery, damaging headstones, and moved across West Maple Avenue severely damaging a landscape business before entering the Ramblewood subdivision. Numerous homes in the subdivision received EF-3 damage with only small interior rooms standing. EF-3 damage persisted as the tornado continued north-northeastward damaging homes between 212th Street and Kestrel Parkway, again leaving only interior rooms standing. Two homes at the intersection of North 212th Street and Larimor Avenue were completely destroyed, resulting in a second instance of EF-4 damage. The tornado then crossed Fort Street about one-third of a mile east of 216th Street, causing the collapse of new development homes. This damage was also consistent with that of an EF-3 tornado. The tornado then veered to the northeast across mainly rural areas of northwestern Douglas County, between Fort Street and Military Road. By the time the tornado crossed Highway 31, it reached its peak width of 1 mile wide. EF-1 damage was noted in this area with several power poles and trees snapped. The tornado narrowed to about one-half mile wide and moved into residential development just northwest of the intersection of 180th Street and Military Road, where EF-1 damage was observed due to loss of roofs. The tornado then moved into Bennington's Newport Landing neighborhood, causing high-end EF-2 damage by removing large sections of several home's roofs and collapsing some exterior walls. The tornado then moved across Bennington Lake, crossing just west of the intersection of Highway 36 and 168th Street, snapping the tops off of numerous trees. It then moved across agricultural land, damaging farm outbuildings southeast of the intersection of 168th Street and Dutch Hall Road, before crossing into Washington County. All walls of this home were collapsed. However, the walls were not attached to the foundation in a way that would discriminate between EF-3 and EF-4 damage. Thus, high-end EF-3 damage was determined. Peak estimated winds for this segment of the tornado's track were at 170 miles per hour. The maximum width of the tornado in this segment was 1450 yards, with an average width of approximately 900 yards. This segment of the tornado is a continuation of the EF-4 tornado that tracked through western Douglas County. After crossing Dutch Hall road into southern Washington County, the tornado damaged homes and farm outbuildings between County Road 29 and County Road 31 from Dutch Hall Road to County Road 36. The width of the tornado at this time ranged from one-third to one-half mile wide. The most significant damage was sustained to a home, machine shop and horse barn, one-third of a mile southeast of the intersection of County Road 40 and County Road 29. Trees were snapped and debarked, the house was moved from its foundation, flat-bed and horse-trailers rolled or lofted, and the machine shop and horse barns destroyed. The storm damage survey following this tornado determined high-end EF-3 damage occurred here. At least one horse was killed, and several others were injured. After this, the tornado crossed the intersection of County Road 36 and County Road 31, producing EF-0 to EF-1 damage in the form of partial roof and siding loss to farm buildings and manufactured homes, plus the snapping of large tree limbs. As it approached State Highway 133, several homes and farm outbuildings sustained EF-2 damage due to the loss of roofs or exterior walls. Crossing Highway 133, the tornado was just less than one-half mile wide, and moved into residential areas generally between County Road 32 and US Highway 75. The most significant damage of the whole tornado track occurred near the intersections of County Road P30 and County Road 33 with the destruction of multiple homes. Several houses were rated with high-end EF-3 damage, and one house was rated as receiving EF-4 damage. Peak winds in this area were estimated to be 170 miles per hour. The tornado then crossed US Highway 75 about 2 miles southeast of Blair moving across the very southern portion of the Cargill plant. The tornado weakened and narrowed, but snapped power poles and derailed several empty rail container cars from the tracks, resulting in EF-1 damage. The peak width of the tornado during this segment of its track was 1900 yards wide, with an average width of around 1000 yards. The tornado continued into southwestern Harrison county in Iowa where it dissipated shortly after crossing US Highway 30. This segment is a continuation of the EF-4 tornado that went through western Douglas and Washington Counties. Upon entering far southwestern Harrison County, the tornado moved across the Missouri River, crossing Highway 30 and the Union Pacific Rail line about one mile east of the Iowa-Nebraska state line. Several trees were snapped and broken, producing EF-0 damage. The tornado then moved across bottomland and agricultural areas, snapping or uprooting several trees and tipping center pivots, producing EF-0 to EF-1 damage. The tornado dissipated approximately 2 miles southwest of Modale, Iowa at 4:29 pm CDT. Peak estimated winds during this segment of the tornado track were estimated at 90 miles per hour. The peak width of the tornado during its track in Harrison County was estimated to be around 350 yards, with an average width of 100 yards.", "f_scale": 4, "wind": 170, "source": "NWS Storm Survey", "state_1": "NE", "state_2": "IA", "state_3": null, "spc_id": null, "ncei_id": "1167568, 1167569, 1167508", "tornado_type": "Tornado", "storm_morphology": "Classic supercell", "satellite_scar": "true", "tds": true, "tropical_cyclone": false, "last_certified": "2024-08-04T14:15:30", "satellite needs review": false, "storm_motion": 29, "storm_direction": 213, "vrot": 107, "nrot": 3.97, "meso_diameter": 0.49, "arl": 710, "radar_distance": 11.21, "radar": "KOAX", "sub_morphology": "RM cell in cluster", "morphology_confidence_high": true, "tds_confidence_high": true, "satellite_scar_degree": "strong", "radar_scan_time": "2024-04-26T21:00:27" }, "geometry": { "type": "LineString", "coordinates": [ [ -96.326844763999986, 41.199911261000011 ], [ -96.322724891, 41.206530414999975 ], [ -96.321351600000014, 41.209048747 ], [ -96.320493293000027, 41.211082713 ], [ -96.31959207, 41.212696927000025 ], [ -96.316244674000018, 41.218346361999977 ], [ -96.314098906000027, 41.223478854 ], [ -96.311566901, 41.226674353000021 ], [ -96.30826242, 41.229611493 ], [ -96.304271293, 41.232742143999985 ], [ -96.300408912000023, 41.236211506000018 ], [ -96.297018599000012, 41.239099810000027 ], [ -96.292791438, 41.244053197000028 ], [ -96.289586402, 41.248978283999975 ], [ -96.285131048999972, 41.254071768000017 ], [ -96.281161380000015, 41.259040151000022 ], [ -96.27583475, 41.265431342 ], [ -96.270534704999989, 41.271447153 ], [ -96.259338926999988, 41.287713882 ], [ -96.25470407, 41.292115426 ], [ -96.251721454, 41.295436541000015 ], [ -96.248653005999984, 41.302207222 ], [ -96.247751784, 41.307591025000022 ], [ -96.246357036, 41.310588997000025 ], [ -96.240413260000025, 41.316536180000014 ], [ -96.234662604, 41.321387002999984 ], [ -96.228127023000013, 41.326693565000028 ], [ -96.220543455999973, 41.332086546000028 ], [ -96.215951513999983, 41.335582853 ], [ -96.209256719999985, 41.340963898999973 ], [ -96.206059526999979, 41.343525377999981 ], [ -96.202797960999987, 41.347004962000028 ], [ -96.198613715000022, 41.351740764 ], [ -96.193077636, 41.357845252 ], [ -96.189429830999984, 41.362499741000022 ], [ -96.186876368000014, 41.365173103000018 ], [ -96.184730601000012, 41.368023494999989 ], [ -96.177520823, 41.377813719000017 ], [ -96.170225215000016, 41.393735788000015 ], [ -96.169230319, 41.403898353999978 ], [ -96.163479662999976, 41.417673932000014 ], [ -96.156870700000013, 41.436337111 ], [ -96.152064182, 41.444765959999984 ], [ -96.140906191999989, 41.452228760000025 ], [ -96.129834033, 41.465865452 ], [ -96.120650150000017, 41.475190784 ], [ -96.114727832000028, 41.491587251 ], [ -96.108548023000026, 41.50688687600001 ], [ -96.104685642, 41.513699831999986 ], [ -96.101166584, 41.521797317999983 ], [ -96.077734806000024, 41.550708642000018 ], [ -96.056191303, 41.569461964000027 ], [ -96.042029238999987, 41.581340534 ], [ -96.027609684000026, 41.590199881999979 ], [ -96.013168670000027, 41.594306454 ] ] } },

Trees and power poles were damaged near the beginning of the path and a house received some shingle damage. EF2 damage was observed as the tornado moved north-northeast and crossed Indian Trails Road where a home was unroofed and many trees were snapped.\nAs the tornado turned more northeast, it struck a Dollar Tree Distribution Center just west of Interstate 35 on the west side of Marietta causing significant roof and exterior wall damage to the facility. The company reported that the building and the inventory were not salvageable. A fatality occurred as the tornado crossed Interstate 35 just northeast of the distribution center and south of State Highway 32 as a southbound semi truck was overturned by the tornado. The driver was injured and the passenger was killed.\nJust east of Interstate 35 along State Highway 32, the tornado destroyed a Dollar General store and a Homeland Grocery Store. NWS surveyors in coordination with a wind engineer rated the destruction of these two buildings as EF4. In this area, the tornado also caused significant damage to a truck stop, hospital and nursing home. The tornado continued north-northeast through the northwestern sections of Marietta continuing to produce tree, roof and power pole damage although damage intensity was not as strong as near State Highway 32.\nAfter moving out of Marietta, the tornado turned northeast again snapping numerous trees and damaging a barn as it approached Lake Murray. The tornado crossed the southeastern portion of Lake Murray near the dam. It severely damaged a mobile home, destroyed a barn and snapped more trees after crossing the lake. The tornado then moved into Carter County near Scott Road. The Marietta-Lake Murray-Dickson Tornado moved from Love County into Carter County near Scott Road just east of Lake Murray. The tornado destroyed one mobile home, heavily damaged another and damaged many trees and power poles between the county line and where it crossed US Highway 70. The tornado turned north-northeast destroying one mobile home and damaging at least two others as it approached the town of Dickson. North of Dickson, at least one other home had significant roof damage and another mobile home was rolled in addition to continued tree and power pole damage.

This tornado developed just north of County Road 1701 southeast of Hominy, where trees were uprooted and snapped. The tornado moved northeast and crossed Highway 20, snapping numerous trees and snapping seven metal power poles. The tornado continued to snap and uproot numerous trees between Highway 20 and Barnsdall. Significant tree damage was found in several locations. A well-built home was destroyed just southwest of town. Multiple vehicles were thrown and rolled, and trees were stubbed and debarked in this area. The tornado then moved into Barnsdall, causing severe damage to the wax plant on the southeast side of town. More than 110 homes and businesses were damaged, 65 of those were destroyed. Numerous trees were stubbed in the area of some of the higher end damage. Two fatalities and at least 33 injuries occurred in Barnsdall. Significant tree damage continued northeast of Barnsdall, a few homes were damaged, and outbuildings were destroyed between Barnsdall and the county line. Based on this damage, maximum estimated wind in this segment of the tornado was 170 to 180 mph. The tornado continued into Washington County. This is the second segment of a two-segment tornado. The tornado crossed into Washington County near Gap Road, and moved across the southwestern portion of Bartlesville, and then across the central and northeastern side of town. An estimated 1000 homes and businesses were damaged in town, some severely. Numerous trees were snapped or uprooted, and many power poles were snapped. A squall line merged with the tornadic supercell, and ultimately ended the tornado process northeast of Bartlesville.

As it developed and tracked northeast, it broke branches off of trees and tore the roof off a farm outbuilding on Willow Avenue. The tornado briefly crossed into Taylor County just south of the Montgomery-Page Street and Tailor-Paige Avenue intersection before tracking into Adams County where it would go on to produce EF-4 damage. The peak winds in the Page County segment of this track were estimated to be at 100 miles per hour. The max width in Page County was measured to be at 85 yards, with an average width estimated at 60 yards. There were no casualties in Page County, though there were 5 fatalities and 35 injuries in the Des Moines NWS CWA. This tornado moved from Page County into Taylor County. The path was very short in Taylor County only catching the extreme northwest corner of the county. No impacts to damage indicators occurred along the path, hence the EFU rating for this portion of the path. The tornado entered into Adams County after clipping the northwest corner of Taylor County. Damage was immediate on the county border with damage to trees and and to farm buildings and power poles within the first few miles in the county. The tornado continued to gain in strength and size as it travelled northeast through southwest Adams county remaining in rural areas south and east of Nodaway. The tornado eventually crossed Federal Highway 34 just north of Brooks with plenty of videos showing a large funnel with debris swirling below it. As the tornado crossed State Highway 148, it gained in strength with EF2 damage becoming more common. Upon reaching the intersection of 150th Street and Notchwood Avenue, EF3 damage occurred with much of an unanchored house losing walls and sliding off the foundation. All outbuildings at this site were also destroyed. As the tornado continued into the north central portion of the county, it encountered several industrial wind mills. Several of the towers collapsed along with the large blades being tossed hundreds of feet through the air. The tornado was multi-vortex at this point with a width of 1300 yards. The tornado exited the county into Adair County between Quince Avenue and Redwood Avenue. The was one death in the county from this tornado when a female driver was ejected from a vehicle which got caught within the circulation. This large and violent tornado entered into south central Adair County from Adams County. The tornado remained a multi-vortex circulation as it moved into the county producing high end damage for much of its remaining path. The tornado encountered several houses in the vicinity of Fontanelle Road and 320th Street. Many of the structures received at least EF2 damage with one house north of the intersection receiving up to EF4 damage with a sufficiently anchored structure destroyed and slumped into a debris field nearby. Additional EF4 damage was noted at a farmstead on Jordan Avenue south of 280th Street with the house destroyed and trees chewed down to only the largest trucks and portions of the bark removed. The path then passed through another wind mill area with additional turbines collapsing west of Kent Avenue. The tornado then passed over Nodaway Park Ponds and entered the southwest side of Greenfield along SW 3rd Street. Several structures over the next several blocks had up to EF4 damage from SW 3rd Street over the SE 3rd Street and South of Linn Street and north of Oak and Noble Streets. Most of these saw complete destruction of the house with much of the debris scattered in the area but not completely swept away. The tornado weakened slightly for the later half of the destructive path through Greenfield. EF3 damage was widespread from SE Kent Street and SE 4th Street to the Intersection of E Iowa Street and NE 8th Street. The tornado exited the east side of Greenfield near the Adair County Fairgrounds. The tornado continued east northeast and gradually weakened impacting a few more houses before dissipating just south of the intersection of 220th Street and Quebec Avenue. This tornado produced at least 35 injuries in addition to 4 deaths within Greenfield. All of the deaths occurred in homes. Of note, according to media reports, a Doppler on Wheels (DOW) intercept research team measured a wind speed of just over 300 mph approximately 150 feet above ground level with this tornado.",
