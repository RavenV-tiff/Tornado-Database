The tornado then traveled northeast across the eastern portion of North Bay before causing damage in the Resota Beach area on the west shore of Deer Point Lake, destroying one double-wide manufactured home and significantly damaging another. The most significant damage in this area was to a single family home on Joanna Lane where large sections of the roof were removed and the garage was destroyed. This was consistent with EF-2 damage. After crossing Deer Point Lake, the tornado tracked through the Bay Head neighborhood where it caused the most extensive damage. One manufactured home on Magnolia Avenue was ripped from its moorings and tossed against the tree line at the back of the property. Fortunately, the two people inside suffered only minor injuries. A single family home at the intersection of Magnolia and Seminole St. had a large portion of its roof removed. Similar damage occurred to a home on Palm Avenue where substantial tree damage also occurred. Four homes in the vicinity of Cherokee St. and Deerwood Avenue sustained similar damage. A brick home on Sunshine Drive not only had about half of its roof removed, but also saw collapse of walls on one corner of the house. All of these homes mentioned thus far in Bay Head suffered EF-2 damage, but this last one was the most severely damaged with winds estimated at 130 mph. As the tornado continued northeast, additional roof damage to homes occurred on Indian Bluff Drive, Indian Bluff Road, Piza Circle, and Miller Circle. On CR 2301 near Vickery Lane, one mobile home was shifted off its support blocks with a third of the structure destroyed. Damage northeast of this point became more sporadic and mainly to trees.

The tornado continued to the northeast before crossing Pandora road where it uprooted a couple large pine trees, one of which fell on an older single wide trailer, which was completely destroyed. Another slightly newer single wide trailer had half of its roof peeled back and blown into the woods behind it to the northeast. The tornado continued to the northeast where it crossed Magnolia road. Several trees were uprooted and snapped along the road. A brand new manufactured home had half of its roof blown off. A trailer park along Mark lane had several large trees snapped or uprooted, and a few roofs were peeled back on some of the single wide homes in the subdivision. The tornado then went on to cross I-10 where an 18 wheeler was knocked over. After crossing I-10, the tornado paralleled Spring Creek road where it snapped and uprooted several large hardwood trees as well as peeled back part of the roof of a shed. The tornado continued to the northeast where it crossed U.S. Highway 90 where a majority of the damage and seven injuries occurred in an RV Park and neighborhood. Several mobile homes where significantly damaged or flipped upside down while being displaced several hundred feet. Several large pine trees where snapped at the base as well. In the subdivision just to the northeast of the RV Park on Rooks Drive, two residential family homes had their roofs completely blown off. A church just across the street from the homes off Merritts Mill road had a cinder block outbuilding collapse. The church building sustained some damage to the gable. The tornado continued to the northeast where several homes off of Janette Drive had partial roof damage as well as sporadic tree damage. The tornado continued to the northeast again through a wooded area before moving through Blue Spring subdivision where extensive damage was observed to the roofs and siding of a majority of the homes. Two homes off of Spring Chase Lane had their roofs blown off along with several large mature hardwoods being snapped at their base. The tornado reached its maximum intensity and width through this stretch just beyond U.S. Highway 90. The maximum width is estimated to be around 600 yards. From the Blue Springs Road subdivision, the tornado continued to the northeast parallel to Blue Springs Road where it snapped and uprooted several trees. The tornado continued along Blue Springs road where it damaged the roofs of several single wide manufactured homes. The tornado continued to the northeast where it collapsed the roof of another church outbuilding along Polar Springs road while also uprooting and snapping several trees on the church property. The tornado crossed Fort road to the northeast of the church where several trees were snapped and uprooted before continuing through a wooded area. The tornado crossed Wintergreen road where a few trees were uprooted along the road, before it dissipated over the field to the northeast of the road. The tornado was rated EF2 with max winds estimated at 125 mph.", "f_scale": 2, "wind": 125, "source": "NWS Storm Survey", "state_1": "FL", "state_2": null, "state_3": null, "spc_id": null, "ncei_id": "1150330", "tornado_type": "Tornado", "storm_morphology": "HP supercell", "sub_morphology": "RM cell in cluster", "satellite_scar": true, "tds": true, "tropical_cyclone": false, "last_certified": "2024-04-28T13:22:42", "satellite_needs_review": false, "storm_motion": 52, "storm_direction": 216, "vrot": 62, "nrot": 2.91, "meso_diameter": 0.41, "arl": 3570, "radar_distance": 44.26, "radar": "KEVX", "morphology_confidence_high": true, "tds_confidence_high": true, "satellite_scar_degree": "moderate", "radar_scan_time": "2024-01-09T12:39:25" }, "geometry": { "type": "LineString", "coordinates": [ [ -85.227572523999982, 30.710001420000026 ], [ -85.222594344000015, 30.724390187999973 ], [ -85.200707518, 30.749030576999985 ], [ -85.193068587000027, 30.757144295999979 ], [ -85.180451475999973, 30.764519811000014 ], [ -85.172469222000018, 30.780301512999984 ], [ -85.165688596999985, 30.789813531999982 ], [ -85.126120650000018, 30.844507797 ], [ -85.113675199999989, 30.867864985999972 ], [ -85.09118755999998, 30.915225024 ] ] } },

The Jackson county portion of the tornado is rated as an EF1. The Houston county portion of the tornado is rated EF2 with max winds estimated at 130 mph. This tornado touched down in a swampy area, just east of Holmes Creek in northwest Jackson County. The tornado initially uprooted and snapped several softwood and hardwood trees, along Hickshill Road and in addition, it damaged an outbuilding there. The tornado continued northeast, damaging more hardwood and softwood trees along Piano Road. The first structure to be impacted by this tornado was a double-wide manufactured home on the northern side of Piano Road. Additional softwood and hardwood trees were snapped and uprooted along Danford Bay Road. Tree damage continued along Orchid Road, Damascus Church Road and Layton Road as the tornado continued to progress northeastward. An outbuilding was damaged along Orchid Road, and a single-family home suffered significant roof damage along Layton Road. The tornado then destroyed two ninety foot, seventy-year-old concrete silos. Damage was found along the entire length of Everett Road which was composed of the snapping and uprooting of trees, along with damage to an outbuilding and a mobile home succumbing to window damage. More trees were damaged along Heislar Road and Peanut Road as the tornado continued its northeastward trek. A single-family home on Peanut Road suffered significant roof damage. When the tornado reached Shiloh Church Loop, a single-family home suffered significant roof damage. The tornado continued to move northeast across Highway 2 where more softwood and hardwood trees were uprooted and snapped. Most of the damage to this point is classified as EF-1. Before the tornado crossed into Alabama, it damaged the roof of a small business on US-231. After crossing into Houston County Alabama, the tornado produced a continuous swath of damage on either side of State Line Road all the way towards the city of Cottonwood. This is also consistent of EF-1 damage. The first instance of EF-2 damage was when the tornado approached Cottonwood proper, along Ramer Loop rolling a single-wide mobile home, destroying it, despite it being well strapped. As the tornado moved through downtown Cottonwood, numerous small businesses sustained damage, ranging from blown out windows, roof damage and in one case the failure of the front-facing brick facade. Additional EF-2 damage occurred when the tornado removed the entire roof of a large two-story home. The tornado continued its northeastward jog, leaving Cottonwood proper, and commenced to destroy a two-story Moose Lodge that was composed of cinder-blocks resulting in another instance of EF-2 damage. The most significant tree damage noted on this survey occurred when the tornado paralleled Dyers Road, thus snapping numerous hardwood and softwood trees. The most significant damage along this northeastward path occurred on September Road where a double-wide home was completely destroyed, and resulted in one fatality. As the tornado continued to move northeast to across Whitaker Road and Creek Church Road, EF-1 tree damage was noted. The tornado caused mainly EF-0 damage to softwood and hardwood trees along Green Frog Road and Ed Tolar Road. One last structural damage occurred to a single-family home where it caused significant roof damage before lifting near the Chattahoochee River. In summary, while most damage was EF-1, there were instances of EF-2 damage with the max wind of 130 mph. In addition to the one fatality, there were also ten direct injuries from the tornado and an additional six indirect injuries during the response phase of the disaster, all in the Cottonwood area.

The tornado began 1.75 miles south of the City of Bamberg along US Hwy 601, near Cry Baby Road. Moving north, the tornado then proceeded to flip a mobile home and cause substantial EF2 damage to a barrel plant at the intersection of US Hwy 601 and US Hwy 301. Door and window failure contributed to the collapse of the middle section of the building and partial collapse of the front section. The collapsed portions of the building were tossed across Chevrolet St into a water tower. The tornado continued north-northeast along US-301 causing widespread EF1 roof and tree damage before moving into downtown Bamberg. As the tornado entered downtown Bamberg, it strengthened to EF2 intensity and caused substantial structural damage to a series of 2-3 story historic buildings just south of the intersection of US Hwy 78 and US Hwy 301. The newer roof section of a building on the west side of US Hwy 301 was thrown completely off onto the adjacent structure. There was a complete collapse of the upper stories of two buildings on the east side of US Hwy 301 with the corner torn off another.

The survey found a 18.6 mile long EF-2 tornado with peak winds of 115 mph occurred on the afternoon of March 14, 2024. The tornado was on the ground for 26 minutes as it touched down 1 mile north of Hanover, IN, and lifted just east of Carrollton, KY. The tornado crossed the Ohio River three times as it started in Jefferson County, IN, crossed the Ohio River into Trimble County, KY, entered Carroll County, KY, crossed the Ohio River back into Jefferson County, IN, crossed into Switzerland County, IN, and crossed the Ohio River for the last time before entering Carroll County, KY. The tornado was 500 yards wide at its maximum.\nThe tornado touched down on Paradise Lane off of Highway 256 on the north side of Hanover, Indiana. the tornado caused shingle and gutter damage, and a couple of large limbs down. The tornado was initially 80 mph, EF-0, with a width of 60 yards. It increased to 90 mph, EF-1, on County Manor Boulevard, taking a roof off a home with sections of the roof twisted around limbs and trees. The width increased to 80 yards.\nIn the area by Birch St. and Ash Dr, the tornado did sporadic tree damage with a few topped and uprooted trees. The width remained at 80 yards and wind speed were EF-0, 80 mph.\nNext the tornado did extensive damage in Jefferson Manor subdivision. Several homes had extensive roof damage and one newer house had the roof completely ripped off. A 1500 pound brick mailbox was knocked over. Several garages sustained major damage and one outbuilding was destroyed. National Weather Service drone photography showed debris thrown up to an eight of a mile. The tornado was 110 mph, EF-1, with a width of 150 yards at this spot.\nThe tornado crossed Indiana 56 and did extensive tree damage on South Revonah Dr. Trees were snapped, uprooted, and twisted in multiple directions. Witnesses saw the tornado, had photography, and heard a loud wind and had their ears pop. Wind speeds of 90 mph EF-1, with a width of 200 yards. There were also some uprooted trees along River Bottom Road.\nThe tornado crossed the Ohio River between River Bottom Road on the Indiana side and Coopers Bottom Road on the Kentucky side, just south of the Clifty Creek Power Plant. The tornado crossed the Ohio River between River Bottom Road on the Indiana side and Coopers Bottom Road on the Kentucky side, just south of the Clifty Creek Power Plant. After the tornado crossed the river, the next observed damage was along Race Track Road. There was extensive tree damage, consisting of uprooted, topped, and twisted trees facing in all directions. Two greenhouses had the plastic roofing material thrown several hundred yards. Three well-built barns next to the greenhouses sustained no damage, nor did the farmhouse. NWS drone photography showed distinct tree damage and greenhouse debris. The tornado was 80 to 85 mph, EF0, with a width of around 200 yards.\nThe tornado then started moving more to the northeast and damaged roof panels on some older barns at the end of Detmer Lane. The tornado was 85 mph, EF0, with a width of 250 yards.\nAt this point, the tornado came down the large hill overlooking Milton and widened significantly, moving parallel to the sharpest curve on US 421. Half of the tornado was over the Ohio River and the other half was just north of US 421 mainly along Coopers Bottom Road. There was a plethora of tree damage all the way to the Milton-Madison Bridge. The tornado was 90 mph, EF1, with a width of around 400 yards. Some of the most dramatic tornado video shows the tornado partially over the Ohio River, sucking up water and throwing it in all directions.\nEF-0 and EF-1 damage continued as the southern half of the funnel entered Milton, doing roof and structural damage to numerous homes and businesses. In addition, numerous hardwood trees were either snapped or uprooted. Just east of downtown Milton, a large brick home under renovation had a large section of its back wall blown out, with estimated winds of 105 mph, which was a bit stronger than points to the west. Noted strengthening occurred over the next mile eastward as more concentrated medium to high end EF-1 damage was noted. Evidence that the center of the tornado was still out over water at this point was strong, given that the downed trees were facing toward the river in almost all instances from Milton eastward until Paradise Point along Highway 36 about 1 mile east of downtown Milton.\nThe center of the tornado finally came on shore at Paradise Point and was immediately at low-end EF-2 strength as several large campers and a motorhome were demolished. One tri-axle camper weighing well over 10,000 pounds was rolled and thrown over 100 yards to the ESE, with debris scattered much farther downstream. Just across Highway 36, a well-built single family residence sustained major roof damage as half of the structure was removed by the tornado. This was also rated at EF-2 strength with winds of 115 mph. Just east of that house, a semi trailer was rolled, a large barn was completely collapsed and shifted, and nearly every tree was snapped in a grove. This was a notable uptick in intensity from areas to the west as snapped trees were more sporadic in those areas. This was more justification for the increase to EF-2. It was at this point that a clear northern portion of the tornado track became evident as downed trees along Highway 36 were laying in a SE direction, pointing inward toward the center of the circulation. It was unclear just how wide the tornado was as it crossed through Milton, since half of the funnel was out over water, however the tornado was around 500 yards wide (roughly a third of a mile) by the time it reached the Trimble/Carroll county line at North Spillman Lane. EF-1/EF-2 intensity remained here as a large span of telephone polls were snapped. There was extensive tree damage just inside of western Carroll County where winds were estimated to be 115 mph, EF-2 strength, before weakening across the rugged Fairview ridge. There was one large barn along Hampton Road that had extensive roof paneling damage and a door blown out. Wind speeds here were estimated to be 90 mph, EF-1. There was a lot of topped tree damage along Locust Creek and Kentucky State Route 36, where wind speeds were estimated to be 85 mph, EF-0.\nAt 1315EST, the tornado moved across the Ohio River again and back into Jefferson County, Indiana. After exiting Carroll County, KY, the tornado crossed the Ohio River for a second time, and increased significantly at the Route 56 Campground. The tornado snapped dozens of trees. The 400 yard wide twister knocked over several RV trailers, and lifting them in the air and wrapping two around trees. The team looked up owner's manuals to determine that actual weight of the various types of trailers. One trailer in particular was a 46-footer, and weighed about 14000 pounds, and was knocked over and moved 5 inches.\nNumerous boat ports, had anchor supports pulled out of the ground, including several buried in a foot of concrete. Debris from the RV park was thrown onto Highway 56 and well beyond into the trees on the north side of the highway. Outbuildings and small barns were destroyed. Wind speeds at the RV Park were 115 mph, EF-2.\nThe tornado crossed in Switzerland county near Green Valley Road. While in Switzerland County, the tornado damaged three barns along Green Valley Road. All the barns sustained significant roof panel damage. Some trees were also uprooted and numerous other trees were topped and snapped. The tornado continued east and caused widespread tree damage on the north hillside along State Route 56. The tornado did extensive power pole and powerline damage, along with tree damage, near the intersection of Patton Hollow Road and State Route 56. Wind speeds were estimated to be 90 mph here with a tornado width of 150 yards. From here, the tornado moved out of Switzerland County at 1322EST as it crossed the Ohio River for a third time, going back into Carroll County, Kentucky. The tornado was very narrow at this point and produced some sporadic tree damage before ending at 1324EST. Wind speeds were estimated to be around 75 mph, EF-0. The Kentucky Mesonet site 2E of Carrollton measured 68 mph as the weakening tornado lifted.", "f_scale": 2, "wind": 115, "source": "NWS Storm Survey", "state_1": "IN", "state_2": "KY", "state_3": null, "spc_id": null, "ncei_id": "1171148, 1171166, 1160988, 1171160, 1160989, 1164886", "tornado_type": "Tornado", "storm_morphology": "Classic supercell", "sub_morphology": "RM discrete cell", "satellite_scar": true, "tds": true, "tropical_cyclone": false, "last_certified": "2024-07-03T04:37:21", "satellite_needs_review": false, "storm_motion": 39, "storm_direction": 274, "vrot": 57, "nrot": 2.23, "meso_diameter": 0.5, "arl": 5030, "radar_distance": 54.53, "radar": "KLVX", "morphology_confidence_high": true, "tds_confidence_high": false, "satellite_scar_degree": "moderate", "radar_scan_time": "2024-03-14T18:11:42" }, "geometry": { "type": "LineString", "coordinates": [ [ -85.474446162, 38.735860843000012 ], [ -85.457084914, 38.731886281000016 ], [ -85.450433035, 38.729877602999977 ], [ -85.42933164599998, 38.725058553999986 ], [ -85.404655322999986, 38.722179155999982 ], [ -85.389634952999984, 38.721810851999976 ], [ -85.380923138000014, 38.725828606 ], [ -85.373627528999975, 38.725728165000021 ], [ -85.366533537, 38.726194879 ], [ -85.347007056, 38.726496199999985 ], [ -85.325248976000012, 38.722880266 ], [ -85.286539335999976, 38.721440536999978 ], [ -85.266283293000015, 38.718293123000024 ], [ -85.246092127999987, 38.714445515000023 ], [ -85.219805974999986, 38.704864828999973 ], [ -85.199120779, 38.699941605999982 ], [ -85.178457545000015, 38.693815363999988 ], [ -85.159555303, 38.693691415999979 ], [ -85.141831266, 38.690609774 ] ] } },

Initially, it snapped and uprooted numerous hardwood trees. As the tornado moved east along Highway 55, it took roofs off multiple homes, overturned and tossed a mobile home, and shifted a single family residence off its foundation. The twister then moved into the center of Irondale, where numerous hardwood and softwood trees were uprooted and snapped, all consistent with EF-2 damage. The tornado was able to descend and climb through steep terrain, with hundreds of trees observed damaged or destroyed from the Highway 55 ridge line and along a steep several hundred foot escarpment. Several trees fell onto homes causing damage. A metal building system lost its roof and part of the side walls. The tornado continued to move east causing downed trees along State Route 213 in Hammondsville, eastward to the Ohio river. After crossing the Ohio River south of Wellsville, the tornado reached peak intensity as it crossed the community of Fairhaven several miles south of Chester, West Virginia. Extensive tree and structural damage was observed along International Drive and Locust Hill Road. There were multiple homes that lost their entire roof and sustained damage to side walls. Numerous barns and outbuildings were completely destroyed. All mature hardwood and softwood trees, some well over 100 years old, were snapped with a few lingering hardwood trees that were debarked. A high-end EF2 rating of 130 mph was observed in this location. Pittsburgh Doppler radar velocity signatures in this area were at the high end of those observed historically, coupled with a significant debris signature aloft. Further damage was observed across Route 8 extending back uphill into the next ridge line, where an auto repair metal outbuilding was destroyed, along with damage sustained to several vintage automobiles. The adjacent property suffered loss of roofing, a porch, and an addition. The tornado then crossed into Pennsylvania. Most of the damage track for this tornado occurred in Ohio and West Virginia.

Each sub-vortex was around mid to high end EF1 intensity with its own focused convergent damage path. Along the centerline of the tornado track, low end EF2 damage to trees occurred in the area. The tornado continued southeast towards I-65, flipping a manufactured home a couple times along State Highway 106 across from the gas station. The tornado became much narrower and weaker as it continued into Georgiana, periodically uprooting or snapping trees along its path. The final observable damage location was near and just east of Taft Skipper Road where a couple outbuildings were destroyed, and a small swath of trees were uprooted in a convergent pattern. This survey was able to be completed with the assistance of NASA SPoRT, NASAMSFC, NASA CSDA and the NASA Disasters Program providing high resolution Planet satellite imagery and with Digital Globe Maxar for high resolution Worldview satellite imagery. Without the availability of this remote sensing imagery, the true path length, width, track, and intensity of this tornado would not have been able to be determined.", "f_scale": 2, "wind": 130, "source": "NWS Storm Survey", "state_1": "AL", "state_2": null, "state_3": null, "spc_id": null, "ncei_id": "1186908, 1185410, 1185411", "tornado_type": "Tornado", "storm_morphology": "QLCS", "sub_morphology": "Line notch", "satellite_scar": true, "tds": false, "tropical_cyclone": false, "last_certified": "2025-01-09T13:13:12", "satellite_needs_review": false, "storm_motion": 58, "storm_direction": 282, "vrot": 43, "nrot": 0.77, "meso_diameter": 1.04, "arl": 7815, "radar_distance": 78.3, "radar": "KEOX", "morphology_confidence_high": true, "tds_confidence_high": false, "satellite_scar_degree": "strong", "radar_scan_time": "2024-05-10T07:09:00" }, "geometry": { "type": "LineString", "coordinates": [ [ -87.064072291, 31.714261126 ], [ -87.062880199, 31.713429569000027 ], [ -87.062258749000023, 31.712931395 ], [ -87.061328917000026, 31.712588627 ], [ -87.06087353800001, 31.711828043000025 ], [ -87.058773068999983, 31.710964011999977 ], [ -87.056303054000011, 31.71022978100001 ], [ -87.052867440999989, 31.708921539000016 ], [ -87.049937274, 31.707077799 ], [ -87.047896412999989, 31.70604536899998 ], [ -87.045650511000019, 31.704461207 ], [ -87.043385538999985, 31.70345106000002 ], [ -87.041518716999974, 31.70308898899998 ], [ -87.039151224000022, 31.703370940000013 ], [ -87.035865813999976, 31.703788794 ], [ -87.033090623000021, 31.703439907000018 ], [ -87.028718025999979, 31.701796872999978 ], [ -87.015938786999982, 31.700064559999987 ], [ -87.005252869, 31.69812936 ], [ -86.998696355999982, 31.697143486000016 ], [ -86.989283591, 31.696952802999988 ], [ -86.982779532999984, 31.696044003999987 ], [ -86.975665126000024, 31.692781992999983 ], [ -86.964392692, 31.691410614 ], [ -86.958446532999972, 31.69263593 ], [ -86.952241381000022, 31.692609595000022 ], [ -86.943686922999973, 31.690276616 ], [ -86.94029694, 31.688175363000028 ], [ -86.937118820000023, 31.687288794999972 ], [ -86.935614070999975, 31.686718199999973 ], [ -86.933783015000017, 31.685590188999981 ], [ -86.931446513000026, 31.684644761000015 ], [ -86.929715595, 31.683711497 ], [ -86.926673371999982, 31.682688951999978 ], [ -86.923402271999976, 31.682826915000021 ], [ -86.916268788000025, 31.68317182200002 ], [ -86.910980662999975, 31.683837286000028 ], [ -86.905258618, 31.683739899999978 ], [ -86.900890788000027, 31.681759724000017 ], [ -86.896670780000022, 31.679941817999975 ], [ -86.889561139000023, 31.677040405000014 ], [ -86.878326015000027, 31.671424020000018 ], [ -86.866204813000024, 31.67015987000002 ], [ -86.859940015, 31.670807126 ], [ -86.851347409000027, 31.66980879 ], [ -86.829784055, 31.666145050000011 ], [ -86.814348834999976, 31.664874742 ], [ -86.809394495999982, 31.66338119400001 ], [ -86.806314131000022, 31.662727760999985 ], [ -86.798687109000014, 31.659383301999981 ], [ -86.791987548, 31.656124061000014 ], [ -86.782348231000014, 31.655246496000018 ], [ -86.776006296999981, 31.652202241 ], [ -86.772735194, 31.650749082 ], [ -86.764681415999974, 31.648963046 ], [ -86.754739359999974, 31.644637852000017 ], [ -86.747660166, 31.642759673 ], [ -86.742624762, 31.641741751999973 ], [ -86.735929968999983, 31.64077355 ], [ -86.722843173, 31.639051259999974 ], [ -86.706650379, 31.638535429 ], [ -86.703655845000014, 31.637877762000016 ], [ -86.694231108, 31.635059199000011 ], [ -86.684587125, 31.631459157999984 ], [ -86.67193897300001, 31.629927442999985 ] ] } },

The tornado began south of Highway 4 to the west of Berrydale where a persistent narrow path of significant tree damage was evident on Planet imagery. This narrow swath continued to be evident in the forest south of Berrydale near Highway 4. Once the tornado passed Highway 87 N it likely intensified significantly as deforestation extent became significant and the tornado turned more to the southeast. After its southeast jog it turned back to the east reaching Highway 4 where ground survey crew initially assessed the tornado. The tornado continued along State Highway 4 about 3 miles west northwest of Munson where pine trees were snapped, and power lines were downed in a convergent pattern. The tornado peaked in intensity at an estimated 115 mph (EF2) over Munson where numerous pine trees were snapped in a convergent pattern in a swath about 450 yards wide. The tornado then took a slight jog to the east-southeast as it essentially paralleled State Highway 4 east of Munson with numerous pine and oak trees snapped on both sides of the road. As the tornado continued east of Munson across the Blackwater River State Forest, it became a broader multivortex with several prominent sub-vortices rotating about the main tornado vortex. Snaps continued into Okaloosa County Florida where the tornado is estimated to have lifted to the northwest of Baker between Highway 4 West and Sherman Kennedy Road.

The tornado track southeastward, snapping and uprooting trees through the remainder of Gadsden County before crossing the Ochlockonee River and entering western Leon County just southwest of U.S. 90. The Gadsden portion of this tornado is rated EF1. This is a continuation of the Gadsden county tornado. The Leon county portion of this tornado is rated EF2. Extensive tree damage was noted at a mobile home park on Emily Loop where several homes were damaged by falling trees. The tornado caused roof and siding damage to a hotel and shopping center near the intersection of Capital Circle Northwest and U.S. 90. The tornado appears to have intensified as it moved southeast after crossing Capital Circle and approaching Blountstown Highway. EF-2 damage was noted to an automotive repair building along Blountstown Highway, along with intense tree damage, with a swath of nearly every pine tree snapped at approximately 75 feet above the ground. This level of damage continues across Pat Thomas Boulevard. Significant tree damage was noted on the campuses of Lively Technical College and Tallahassee Community College before the tornado crossed Appleyard Drive. Another area of intense tree damage was noted along Cactus Drive, consistent with an EF-2 rating. Numerous homes were damaged by falling trees. The tornado then moved through a densely populated area of single family and multi-family homes, causing widespread EF-1 tree damage. Numerous homes and businesses were damaged by falling trees as the tornado crossed Pensacola Street and approached the Florida State University Campus. Numerous trees were downed on the southwestern part of the campus. In addition, the tent housing the Florida State University Flying High Circus was destroyed and the outfield fence at Dick Howser Stadium was severely damaged. The tornado moved along Gaines Street, causing damage to a few businesses, and causing a construction crane to collapse. At Railroad Square, several warehouse buildings were severely damaged, along with the roof of the railroad depot. Snapped and uprooted trees were also noted in the downtown area, just south of the State Capital Building near the state Department of Education Building. At this point, the tornado began to turn more southeastward as it began to interact with the nearby tornado to its south. The tornado caused damage at Cascades Park, and significant tree damage in Myers Park. The tornado then moved through Country Club Estates and onto the Capital City Country Club. At this time, the track converged with that of the tornado to the south, with the tornado to the south appearing to become the dominant feature moving forward.

The tornado would then continue trekking east-southeast before making a hard right and traveling due east as it passed the intersection of Blountstown Highway and Ft. Braden Trail Road, producing damage consistent with an EF-1 rating by snapping numerous hardwood and softwood trees along the way. The tornado would then continue east, paralleling Blountstown Highway as it then impacted Lake Talquin State Recreational Area where it would continue producing EF-1 damage by snapping trees. The tornado would then shift its trajectory to east-southeast once again, impacting many subdivisions in the Norfleet neighborhood south of Blountstown Highway snapping numerous trees across the area. It would then continue on its east- southeast path before traveling east once again as it reached just north of the intersection of Capital Circle SW and Orange Ave W in Tallahassee. It would then go on to impact the neighborhoods of Seminole Manor and Mabry Manor snapping many trees along the way and causing damage to Sabal Palm Elementary School. The tornado would then continue its eastern track impacting Florida A&M University (FAMU) producing EF-1 damage by snapping numerous trees along the way. This included roof damage to at least two university buildings. EF-0 damage was observed a handful of times to eve's on homes and businesses as well as occasional shingle damage. The tornado would continue moving east toward Capital City Country Club Golf Course producing EF-1 damage by snapping numerous trees along the way and across the golf course. The tracks of both tornadoes moving through Tallahassee at this time converged at Capital City Country Club, with this tornado seemingly becoming the dominant circulation moving forward. As the tornado exited the golf course, very intense tree damage consistent with an EF-2 rating was observed as numerous trees were snapped at a height of around 75 feet. This most intense tree damage occurred from Country Club Dr. through the Indian Head Acres subdivisions. This is where the maximum estimated winds of 115mph most likely occurred. EF-1 damage would be observed through the remainder of its eastern trajectory as the tornado impacted Old St. Augustine Rd. It would go on producing EF-1 tree damage within the subdivision of Paradise Village East, Old Friends Rd, and areas along Southwood Plantation Rd before moving on to mostly forested areas north of Old St. Augustine Rd. The last concentrated area of EF-1 damage would be observed in neighborhoods along Louvinia Drive and WW Lee Road. The tornado would then continue east before uprooting a few trees along U.S. 27 as it moved to the Leon-Jefferson county line before dissipating. The tornado reached its maximum width of 1400yds as it crossed Monroe St. in downtown Tallahassee and entered into the Capital City Country Club Golf Course. Unfortunately, two fatalities occurred in association with this tornado, both due to trees falling. In one case, trees fell through a mobile home, and in the other case, a tree fell on a person who was outdoors.", "f_scale": 2, "wind": 115, "source": "NWS Storm Survey", "state_1": "FL", "state_2": null, "state_3": null, "spc_id": null, "ncei_id": "1186559", "tornado_type": "Tornado", "storm_morphology": "QLCS", "sub_morphology": "Line notch", "satellite_scar": true, "tds": true, "tropical_cyclone": false, "last_certified": "2025-01-10T06:05:13", "satellite_needs_review": false, "storm_motion": 60, "storm_direction": 284, "vrot": 53, "nrot": 1.25, "meso_diameter": 0.21, "arl": 355, "radar_distance": 6.93, "radar": "KTLH", "morphology_confidence_high": true, "tds_confidence_high": true, "satellite_scar_degree": "strong", "radar_scan_time": "2024-05-10T10:52:09" }, "geometry": { "type": "LineString", "coordinates": [ [ -84.521681306, 30.449018235999972 ], [ -84.494183299999975, 30.440231176 ], [ -84.450409649, 30.438455169 ], [ -84.353764292999983, 30.423653850999983 ], [ -84.308581410999977, 30.428091707000021 ], [ -84.289535581, 30.425864016 ], [ -84.27861791700002, 30.425360743 ], [ -84.266550121000023, 30.425086900999986 ], [ -84.243684826, 30.423917518999986 ], [ -84.210013447999984, 30.42134927 ], [ -84.183165605, 30.417855748000022 ], [ -84.141297400999974, 30.412748469 ], [ -84.103927252, 30.410136436000016 ], [ -84.070521951999979, 30.411498441999981 ] ] } },

Estimated wind gusts in this vicinity were near 90 MPH to 95 MPH. The tornado continued to track across a farm hillside, then it hit a small shed in a planning community on Equestrian Drive. Tree damage was also noted along Equestrian Drive, Bride Trail, Turkeyfoot Road, Fox Run Road, and Doubletree Drive.\nThe tornado intensified near Church Hill Road and Greyhawk Circle, where a two story garage received heavy damage. The roof and side walls were tossed 50 to 75 yards downstream. Large hardwood trees were also snapped and/or uprooted next to the destroyed garage between Kingston Circle and Greyhawk Circle.\nShingle damage was noted to a number of homes along Kingston Circle and Hedgerow Drive. Viral video footage was captured along Longleaf Drive as the tornado tracked over a field and impacted homes along McClelland Road. one home on McClelland Road lost 50% of its roof, had a destroyed shed, and a number of trees were either snapped or uprooted surrounding the property. Their neighbor had their entire garage destroyed and had some shingle damage. The tornado lifted the metal roof of the garage and siding over 500 yards towards Route 88.\nThe tornado continued towards Walter Long Road and caused roof damage at Crossroads Ministries. A religious service was being held at the time and two attendees received minor injuries as broken glass from windows blew out. The church steeple broke free from the front of the building and landed in pieces on a few parked cars. About 1,000 square feet of the church lost its entire roof. Insulation from the church was found 2.5 miles away in some trees (along Stone Church Road). As the tornado tracked towards State Route 88, the range of maximum wind speed was between 111 MPH to 118 MPH.\nSignificant tree damage was noted and a power pole between Morgan Lane and Ridge Avenue was snapped adjacent to Route 88. The tornado continued towards Brownsville Road Extension where large trees were uprooted and/or snapped and roof damage was visible to a home. A storage shed, at the intersection of Chevy Chase Drive, Mcchain Road, and Seward Road, lost over 20% of its metal roof and portions of its side walls.\nAdditional tree damage was noted along Curry Lane, Dennison Lane, Aber Road, and Lobbs Run Road before the tornado dissipated less than 2 miles northwest of Elrama.", "f_scale": 2, "wind": 120, "source": "NWS Storm Survey", "state_1": "PA", "state_2": null, "state_3": null, "spc_id": null, "ncei_id": "1180407", "tornado_type": "Tornado", "storm_morphology": "LP supercell", "sub_morphology": "RM discrete cell", "satellite_scar": true, "tds": true, "tropical_cyclone": false, "last_certified": "2025-01-10T06:51:52", "satellite_needs_review": false, "storm_motion": 20, "storm_direction": 276, "vrot": 39, "nrot": 1.01, "meso_diameter": 0.97, "arl": 1255, "radar_distance": 18.41, "radar": "KPBZ", "morphology_confidence_high": true, "tds_confidence_high": true, "satellite_scar_degree": "moderate", "radar_scan_time": "2024-05-11T22:11:53" }, "geometry": { "type": "LineString", "coordinates": [ [ -80.058854434000011, 40.273102823999977 ], [ -80.055399749, 40.272300611 ], [ -80.04786810600001, 40.270810761 ], [ -80.04525027, 40.270024893000027 ], [ -80.042782638, 40.269255389000023 ], [ -80.041559550999978, 40.268927937 ], [ -80.038941715000021, 40.268649601999982 ], [ -80.035894725, 40.26848587500001 ], [ -80.033663127000011, 40.268371265999974 ], [ -80.031152580000025, 40.268191166 ], [ -80.028534744000012, 40.267863708999982 ], [ -80.025273176999974, 40.267568997000012 ], [ -80.02377114, 40.267405267000015 ], [ -80.020337913, 40.267307029 ], [ -80.017376754, 40.267208790999973 ], [ -80.010853622000013, 40.266946822000023 ], [ -80.008192870000016, 40.266750345 ], [ -80.002871368, 40.26596443 ], [ -79.995146606, 40.264458067000021 ], [ -79.989825102999987, 40.26295167 ], [ -79.986563537, 40.262231208 ], [ -79.984074447000012, 40.261772727999983 ], [ -79.980641219, 40.26144524 ], [ -79.977293823000025, 40.261510738000027 ], [ -79.974976394, 40.261903722999989 ], [ -79.972143980999988, 40.26242769800001 ], [ -79.969569061000016, 40.262493195 ], [ -79.963303419999988, 40.261707231 ], [ -79.949055526, 40.260004276000018 ] ] } },

The tornado blew windows out of the high school and continued to produce tree and minor roof damage through the Ashton Point neighborhood. The tornado crossed Camp Dodge and blew down a tree along NW Beaver Drive before crossing Saylorville Reservoir. The tornadoes path took it between Polk City and Ankeny with EF0 damage to trees and houses along Highway 415 and NW 44th Street. The damage began to intensify as the tornado moved northeast with EF1 damage becoming more prevelent in neighborhoods south of Alleman. The first EF2 damage was found on 142nd Avenue just west of Interstate 35 with additional EF2 damage to several houses near the intersection of NE 150th Avenue and NE 29th Street on the east side of the Interstate. The path continued to widen with additional damage near the border with Story County. This tornado moved into Story County near the intersection of NE 42nd Street and NE 166th Avenue. This tornado produced two injuries in Polk County. This tornado moved into Story County from Polk County. The tornado was quite wide at this point nearing 1000 yards wide at times. Along Highway 210 southeast of Cambridge, 8 large wooden and relatively new higher voltage power poles were snapped. Trees were obliterated along 315th Street east of Cambridge. Additional EF2 damage occurred 620th Avenue where numerous outbuildings were destroyed. A house was completely removed from its foundation at the intersection of 270th Street and Woods Rd and was tossed across 270th Street. However, the house was undergoing a remodel at the time and had no anchorage to the pour concrete foundation, hence the EF2 rating at this location. Damage to a house along 250th Street southeast of Nevada was extensive with the house shifted off the foundation and much of the interior savaged by flying debris and mud. All the outbuildings at this location were destroyed with the debris strewn far downwind. Another brick house at the intersection of Highway 30 and 650th avenue had extensive damage with only the front of the house still intact. These last two houses had high end EF2 damage and it appears this is where the tornado was strongest. EF2 damage was still found downstream for several more miles but was not as extensive as what had been seen just southeast and east of Nevada. The last extensive damage with the tornado occurred along 160th Street between 710th and 720th Avenue where a house lost half of its roof and then hit a hog house about a half a mile later. The tornado then weakened and dissipated shortly before reaching 150th Street.

This tornado started to move just north of the southern tornado as it crossed Highway 5, ripping a roof off a home consistent with EF-2 damage. Lifting further north, the tornado cross over some neighborhoods east of Arkansas Highway 5 in northwest portions of Briarcliff, causing mainly tree damage and some minor structural damage. At this point, the tornado began moving in a more northeast direction towards Sycamore Heights, then eventually lifting in the Sycamore Spring neighborhood.

However, the damage in Northern Red River Parish was rated as high-end EF-1, with estimated maximum winds near 105 mph, with the stronger EF-2 rated damage found farther north in Central Bossier Parish. This is a continuation of the Northern Red River Parish EF-2 tornado. This tornado, with estimated maximum winds near 115 mph, crossed Loggy Bayou Road and Highway 515 and across Highway 71 just west of the Loggy Bayou Wildlife Management Area, where several trees were snapped and uprooted, and minor to moderate structural damage occurred due to fallen trees and limbs downed onto these structures. The tornado then crossed Highway 154 east of Elm Grove, where approximately 10 trees were snapped/uprooted at a residence, with an intense burst of tree damage observed farther north on Robinson Road. The tornado continued north-northwest and paralleled Highway 157, where numerous hardwood and softwood trees were snapped near and north of Wilkerson Road, before crossing Highway 527 and Goathill Road. Extensive damage was observed to some structures and vehicles from fallen trees as the tornado crossed Sligo Road, before the tornado entered the eastern sections of Barksdale Air Force Base. The damage over the eastern sections of Barksdale Air Force Base was over heavily forested areas, with numerous softwoods snapped and uprooted, before the tornado crossed Interstate 20 and Highway 79 west of Haughton where several trees were snapped and uprooted, large limbs snapped, and some damage was observed to homes due to falling trees, with downed power poles and power lines, with the more extensive damage noted on Wafer Road and Cindy Lane. The tornado continued on a north-northwest trajectory with extensive damage again noted to homes from fallen trees on Bellevue Road at Busby Road and Bellevue Farm Drive before crossing Red Chute Bayou. Extensive damage was again observed near East Linton Road, Crouch Road, and Linton Bellevue Roads, where several homes were damaged from fallen trees. Two fatalities were reported on East Linton Road when a tree fell on a mobile home, killing a 31 year old woman and her grandmother, while injuring one child. The tornado nearly paralleled Crouch Road before crossing Highway 162 north and east of Cypress Bayou Reservoir. The strongest winds with the tornado were found along Crouch Road east of Benton by Civil Air Patrol imagery, which depicted high-end tree damage consistent with lower EF-2 wind speeds. More tree and power line damage was observed on Old Plain Dealing Road before the tornado finally lifted just north of Highway 2 west of Plain Dealing. In all, 164 manufactured and single family homes were damaged or affected by this tornado throughout Bossier Parish.

Toward the end of the tornado cycle, between roughly 8:15-8:20 pm CDT, it intensified once again, becoming narrower and tracking from southwest to northeast, crossing 119th St between 301st and 302nd Ave. The track was clearly seen through a corn crop before lifting. Around this same time, a distinct smaller tornado/vortex damaged a farmstead. At this location, a tree was uprooted, a silo was dented, and two shop buildings lost roof panels and doors. Additionally, a travel trailer was rolled 100 feet across 119th St, with debris tossed from north-northeast to south-southwest into a cornfield. Two other smaller tornadic circulations were also noted in the corn crop just west of the intersection of 302nd Ave and 119th St.", "f_scale": 2, "wind": 130, "source": "NWS Storm Survey", "state_1": "SD", "state_2": null, "state_3": null, "spc_id": null, "ncei_id": "1207072", "tornado_type": "Tornado", "storm_morphology": "Classic supercell", "sub_morphology": "RM discrete cell", "satellite_scar": true, "tds": true, "tropical_cyclone": false, "last_certified": "2024-11-25T23:24:32", "satellite_needs_review": false, "storm_motion": 15, "storm_direction": 301, "vrot": 65, "nrot": 1.72, "meso_diameter": 1.75, "arl": 6705, "radar_distance": 66.84, "radar": "KBIS", "morphology_confidence_high": true, "tds_confidence_high": true, "satellite_scar_degree": "moderate", "radar_scan_time": "2024-08-29T00:49:04" }, "geometry": { "type": "LineString", "coordinates": [ [ -100.243076327999972, 45.683712287 ], [ -100.24135972, 45.682764863999978 ], [ -100.238613132000012, 45.68275287 ], [ -100.237046726000017, 45.682973237999988 ], [ -100.234888083999977, 45.684419844 ], [ -100.233240132999981, 45.684263941999973 ], [ -100.231712347999974, 45.683352507 ], [ -100.230922705000012, 45.680941931 ], [ -100.230815416999974, 45.677219423 ], [ -100.229304797, 45.673831023 ], [ -100.227407938, 45.671815875999982 ], [ -100.221256024000013, 45.666301255 ], [ -100.216730601, 45.665080203 ], [ -100.212868222, 45.662290929 ], [ -100.210482128000024, 45.661397132 ], [ -100.207375055999989, 45.661097197 ], [ -100.203667172, 45.661511107000024 ], [ -100.193225864999988, 45.662877289 ], [ -100.186702728, 45.662133466 ], [ -100.180282599, 45.661077698999975 ], [ -100.175012591999973, 45.660501819999979 ], [ -100.170995721999986, 45.660453830999984 ], [ -100.168077478999976, 45.661413628 ], [ -100.164335263, 45.663345171 ], [ -100.162481312000011, 45.665456596000013 ], [ -100.15968323300001, 45.66769989300002 ], [ -100.159048084, 45.669511263 ] ] } },

The Miami WSR-88D radar picked up a couple different tornado debris signatures with this supercell before it crossed into Martin County and moved east of Indiantown. Maximum wind speed and EF rating are unknown with path width estimated from observations. The tornado, which produced a large swath of EF-0 and EF-1 damage, and a small section of EF-2 damage, was one of several tornadoes to impact the area as Hurricane Milton's outer rainbands swept across the Treasure Coast. Based on radar dual polarimetric data, this tornado initially touched down in Palm Beach County.\nAs it moved into rural Martin County, the system intersected a few homes south of SW Kanner Hwy. A large, newer construction home, experienced major damage when nearly all of its roof was torn back and tossed onto an adjacent home. Nearby metal storage structures were also significantly damaged, indicating EF-2 winds of 115 - 125 mph. The tornado continued northward through rural Martin County where sporadic damage to vegetation and residential structures was witnessed along Citrus Blvd, producing winds ranging from 85 to 105 mph (EF-0 to EF-1). The circulation damaged several industrial buildings, including the canopy of a gas station, near SW Martin Hwy and SW 42nd Ave.\nThe tornado subsequently crossed Florida's Turnpike where it then entered several subdivisions before crossing into St. Lucie County, producing only minor (EF-0) damage given that most of the homes were concrete block structures. A NWS Storm Survey confirms that a tornado, which initially touched down in Palm Beach County (near SR 98) and continued into Martin County, produced additional damage in St. Lucie County. The circulation entered Martin County near Harbor Ridge Yacht and Country Club where it produced minor (EF-0) damage to a few of the mainly concrete block structure homes within the subdivision.\nVideo from SKYWARN Spotters indicate the tornado then emerged into the St. Lucie River and became a well-defined waterspout. The waterspout moved ashore the St. Lucia River Club at Ballantrae where significant vegetative damage and minor property damage resulted consistent with an EF-1 tornado with peak winds of up to 90 mph.\nVegetative damage, along with sporadic property damage mainly in the form of shingle loss, soffit damage, etc. continued generally in a north direction across US-1 and into the Savannas Preserve State Park in Port St. Lucie, coincident with EF-0 type damage with winds up to 80 mph.\nRadar data suggests the tornado intensified briefly before entering the Indian River Estates subdivision where numerous homes were affected. Here, several parked vehicles were flipped and tossed, and a few homes experienced partial roof loss, suggesting the tornado produced peak winds of up to 95 mph.
