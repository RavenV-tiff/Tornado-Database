Beyond the structures, numerous large pine trees were uprooted or snapped. When the tornado was near peak intensity several large pine trees were snapped in close proximity with several very large pine trees uprooted. Tree damage was noted beyond reachable distance due to the downed trees blocking the path further into the woods. From surveying on the northwest side of the track along an accessible road, no additional damage was noted, and the tornado is presumed to have lifted before reaching B Green Road and Parramore Fish Pond Road.

Some trees were snapped near the interstate with wind speeds estimated at 85 mph, which is EF-0 with a width of 50 yards.\nThe tornado increased in windspeed and width at the end of Henretty Road. The tornado destroyed two large older barns, taking the metal sheeting from the barn and twisting it around numerous trees. Some boards were impaled in the ground. Drone photography was instrumental in determining the tornado by delineating downed tree damage. Trees were snapped, uprooted, and topped, with trees lying from the north northeast to the east southeasterly direction. A nearby family home had soffit, gutter, and shingle damage. Winds were estimated at 90 mph with a width of 75 yards.\nThe tornado continued to the east, snapping power poles along US 31 and uprooting a couple of trees. Winds were estimated at 80 mph with a width of 60 yards.\nThe tornado did extensive damage along Old State Road. A mixture of hardwood and softwood trees were facing from the north northeast all the way to the southerly direction. Winds were estimated at 87 mph with a width of 60 yards. There was no evidence of any further tornadic damage off Beagle Club Road past the large pond just east of Old State Road.\nEven though there was a tornado, there were many dozens of trees that were topped and uprooted by straight line winds in the Underwood community. Some trees fell on outbuildings, power lines, and blocked roads including US 31. One home at 310 Henretty Road had a large portion of the roof collapse into the bedroom. Fortunately, the homeowner had gone down to check on his sump pump just before a large portion of the roof collapsed onto his bed. Winds were 85 mph at this location. The straight line winds started by knocking over an Amazon truck on Interstate 65 at the 23 mile marker. Straight line wind damage in Underwood ranged from 75 to 85 mph.\nThere was sporadic straight line wind damage from Underwood to Marysville and New Washington. The most significant damage was near IN 3 and IN 203 at a sod farm, where a large 100 x 50 foot barn had major roof and siding damage. Drone photography showed no tree damage next to this barn and all of the barn damage fell to the east into a field. Wind speeds were estimated to be 85 mph.\nThe survey team drove to Washington County, Indiana, and looked at damage along Canton South Boston Road. Straight line winds of 80 to 85 mph uprooted or snapped 11 trees in a forest grove on the west side of the road and destroyed two storage buildings.

A few houses received light damage to roofs and a few trees were knocked down. Additional light tree debris was noted along East Anthony Street toward College Avenue. The tornado continued eastward, causing tree and minor roofing damage to houses on Devonshire and Cumberland Drive. One house on Devonshire Drive had more significant roof damage. The tornado moved east from there, causing damage to the Menards store and Eastview Park, before crossing State Route 29. Sporadic tree damage was found between State Route 703 and State Route 29 as the tornado continued east. A few homes on Long Pine Drive and surrounding courts were damaged.\nAs the tornado neared Riley Road, it took on a more northeast motion, damaging several buildings south of State Route 29 before crossing from south to north. Damaged outbuildings, homes, and snapped/uprooted trees were then observed along Four Turkey Road north of State Route 29. After the tornado crossed State Route 29, the width of observed damage grew quite significantly, suggesting the circulation of the tornado grew. The observed damage, mostly consisting of damaged out-buildings, a few houses, and numerous trees, indicated an intensification of the tornado as well, with a swath of EF-1 damage stretching from Four Turkey Road to the Mercer/Auglaize County line. The tornado entered Auglaize County at 1808EST and continued east across the western part of the county before ending between Bay Road and Kettlersville Road at 1824EST. The tornado initially began in the city of Celina in Mercer County, Ohio, at 1800EST. It moved east and entered Auglaize County, just north of State Route 29 at 1808EST. The tornado continued east, producing EF1 damage from the county line to around the intersection of State Route 116 and Markey Road, where the observed damage consisted mostly of damaged out-buildings, a few damaged houses, and numerous downed trees.\nTo the east of State Route 116, the tornado began to slowly contract in size as it continued eastward. Radar data showed a steady eastward motion with the circulation remaining intact for seven additional miles. The observed damage during this portion of the tornado was mostly tree related.

As the tornado crossed U.S. Route 23, it strengthened and widened and caused more widespread structural damage as it crossed the Olentangy River. Even more significant damage occurred as it moved along Berlin Station Road and in other areas of Berlin Township. Along this portion of the track, a number of homes sustained siding and roof damage and numerous trees were snapped and uprooted. Several barns were also destroyed. In the vicinity of Olentangy Berlin High School, parts of the school campus and athletic fields were damaged, signs were bent over, and several free-standing transmission towers were felled. In this area, maximum wind speeds were estimated to be around 110 mph.\nThe tornado crossed Alum Creek Reservoir and moved into neighborhoods southwest of Sunbury and west of Galena, where it caused widespread and significant tree damage and a large number of homes had windows blown out, roofs partially removed, and power poles snapped. Damage in these areas was consistent with wind speeds from 95 to 105 mph.\nAs the tornado moved through the Galena area, there was a complex mix of straight-line wind damage through southern parts of the town of Galena with tornadic damage embedded across the north side of Galena. The damage field through this area was notably wide.\nThe tornado entered Licking County at 2022EST, about 3 miles SSE of Condit, and continued to moved east-southeast across much of northern Licking County before ending at 2050 EST, about 1 mile south-southeast of St. Louisville. The tornado developed at 2001EST, about 3 miles south of Delaware, and moved east southeast across Delaware County. It entered Licking County at 2021EST, about 4 miles west-southwest of Hartford, where the damage path remained quite wide and was likely a complex mix of straight-line winds on the immediate southern flank of the tornadic circulation. However, the damage was very consistent with wind speeds ranging from 90 to 100 mph across most of Licking County. Along this entire stretch of the damage path, the damage was a combination of partial roofs removed on some homes, barns completely destroyed or heavily damaged, widespread trees uprooted and snapped, and power poles snapped.\nThe tornado dissipated between State Route 13 and Horns Hills Road south of St. Louisville.", "f_scale": 1, "wind": 110, "source": "NWS Storm Survey", "state_1": "OH", "state_2": null, "state_3": null, "spc_id": null, "ncei_id": "1167932, 1167943", "tornado_type": "Tornado", "storm_morphology": "HP supercell", "sub_morphology": "RM cell in cluster", "satellite_scar": true, "tds": true, "tropical_cyclone": false, "last_certified": "2024-07-06T13:20:03", "satellite_needs_review": false, "storm_motion": 42, "storm_direction": 277, "vrot": 60, "nrot": 2.0, "meso_diameter": 1.16, "arl": 6475, "radar_distance": 65.2, "radar": "KILN", "morphology_confidence_high": true, "tds_confidence_high": false, "satellite_scar_degree": "weak", "radar_scan_time": "2024-03-15T01:09:10" }, "geometry": { "type": "LineString", "coordinates": [ [ -83.067830199000014, 40.259897027000022 ], [ -83.063345546, 40.25986427700002 ], [ -83.040682065999988, 40.258431906 ], [ -83.022314299000016, 40.255287803999977 ], [ -83.002573241, 40.250309343000026 ], [ -82.98234456199998, 40.244170039999972 ], [ -82.954535419000024, 40.239911469 ], [ -82.927241260000017, 40.236700985000027 ], [ -82.903208667, 40.233031674000017 ], [ -82.884411746000012, 40.228510285000027 ], [ -82.866816455, 40.225889051000024 ], [ -82.840638094999974, 40.223726457999987 ], [ -82.805876666000017, 40.219794292000017 ], [ -82.783303194999974, 40.216976100000011 ], [ -82.755659426000022, 40.211573574999989 ], [ -82.734523619000015, 40.208476458 ], [ -82.704783285000019, 40.206673837999972 ], [ -82.689591253, 40.2030029 ], [ -82.677660788000026, 40.199003974 ], [ -82.657104338000011, 40.196152137000013 ], [ -82.636547888, 40.192283936000024 ], [ -82.622214163000024, 40.19031696899998 ], [ -82.607022131, 40.189530166 ], [ -82.583075369000028, 40.186579575999986 ], [ -82.570587004, 40.184514085999979 ], [ -82.551146352999979, 40.182907549999982 ], [ -82.532199304000017, 40.182473970999979 ], [ -82.518466392999983, 40.181818227 ], [ -82.509046399999988, 40.180218976 ], [ -82.485357130000011, 40.175726854 ], [ -82.463899458000014, 40.168283046999989 ], [ -82.449951971000019, 40.164085297999975 ], [ -82.438021505, 40.161461573 ], [ -82.423559034, 40.15955931000002 ], [ -82.410810616999981, 40.157531512 ] ] } },

Much of the landscaping around the house wasn't disturbed. An outdoor hot tub on the northern end of the west side of the house had its heavy cover broke and thrown to the southwest. The southwest side of this well constructed house had a section of its roof decking torn off and thrown which can be seen in the video. Wind speeds were estimated at 95 mph based on this damage. In one area of the house, the damage penetrated the ceiling. In other parts, the ceiling has been lifted away from the walls. Much of the soffit around the house has been sucked in or blown out. Some insulation from the attic is stuck to the east side of the house with additional amounts on the south facing exposed surfaces like door jambs and light fixtures. This is evidence of cyclonic flow. A patio chair that was sitting behind the house was found approximately 133 yards away in the woods.\nApproximately 100 yards east of the house, a few mature trees have been snapped on the edge of the woods. Farther in the woods, roofing debris was found on the ground and in trees as far 380 yards from where it came. The main section of roof that was thrown, and can been seen on video, wasn't located. Many trees were freshly damaged or uprooted in the woods, but many of those were already dead.\nThe video showed the tornado strengthening and weakening with a condensation funnel barely visible at times. It showed inflow being pulled into the tornado which was strong enough to bring down compromised trees. The tornado can also be seen dropping and lifting very small vortices as it approached Georgetown. Minor tree damage was found off of Georges Hill Road and west of Georgetown County Line Road before the tornado cross into Floyd County. The National Weather Service in Louisville conducted a damage assessment survey of a tornado that started at a property off of Hidden Springs Drive in far eastern Harrison County, Indiana and ended near Watts Road, just south of Georgetown, in Floyd County. Video clearly showed the tornado touching down multiple times. In Harrison County the tornado was rated EF1, but in Floyd County it was rated EF0.\nAs the tornado crossed Georgetown County Line Road into Floyd County, there was an uptick in how widespread the damage was, and the damage was slightly more impressive with a few large branches being snapped.\nBetween Old Lanesville Road and Georgetown Lanesville Road, scattered tree damage continued with a large tree being uprooted. Several compromised trees were brought down too. An eyewitness that was on Georgetown Lanesville Road during the storm said she saw a finger of a tornado touch down at a house on that road before lifting. She didn't see the tornado touch down again.\nThe last of the damage was found off of Watts Road. A house just west of the road had damage to its gutter covers.

It quickly moved northeast over mainly rural lands before causing more substantial tree and powerline damage as it crossed Morganza Highway when it became wider. The tree damage became increasingly more widespread and intense as the tornado crossed Levee Road and the Mississippi River from Pointe Coupee Parish and entered into West Feliciana Parish. A strong and long-lived tornado entered West Feliciana Parish from Pointe Coupee Parish near the Cat Island Refuge. A combination of in person and NDVI differencing on satellite data was used to survey this tornado. The tree and powerline damage became increasingly more widespread and intense as the tornado crossed Levee Road and the Mississippi River. High resolution satellite imagery identified a focused swath of tree damage (snaps and uproots) roughly 200 yards in width that continued northeast through the Cat Island National Wildlife Refuge up through US Highway 61. Tree damage was observed on Highway 61 with another large swath of tree damage further northeast on Bains Road. Due to the heavily wooded and rural areas, ground surveys were impeded in identifying parts of this track as it continued northeast. Only patches of tree damage was observed in high resolution and identified in a follow up storm survey across Pepper Drive. At this time, a complex handoff to a new stronger tornado (Bains-Spillman) was underway to this tornado's east. The only apparent indication that this tornado damage path continued was difference in damage orientation on the western flank of the broader damage path as it crossed Spillman Road and a separate NDVI damage path was noted west of the new tornado damage path to the east.

As the tornado raced north-northeast, it quickly grew in size and strength and the most significant damage began after the tornado crossed Polk Brannon Road. Aerial drone footage denoted a large section of significant tree damage resulting in 70-80% of tree fall in a strongly convergent pattern. This is where the tornado was estimated to be at its strongest at EF-1 110 mph and widest at around 700 yards wide. Ground survey was able to access along Spillman and Jones Vaughn Creek Road where numerous trees were snapped, large hardwood trees were uprooted, and several wooden electrical transmission poles were snapped. The damage path was measured to be around a half mile in this vicinity with widespread tornadic damage evident in combination with the Labarre-Bains tornado that was estimated to have crossed just to the west. Ground surveys were impeded in Spillman due to widespread tree damage from this tornado, but the prolific damage path remained between 150 and 350 yards wide as it tracked northeast along Highway 421. The complex interaction between this tornado and the Labarre-Bains tornado at the latter stage of its life likely contributed to the fluctuation in the damage path width. The remaining portion of a long track tornado entered Wilkinson County from West Feliciana approximately 2.5 miles east of Highway 967 or Jackson Louisiana Road. Ground surveys were impeded due to lack of road access. High resolution satellite analysis was used for this survey. Downed trees indicated that the tornado continued for about 1 mile into Mississippi before it lifted. This was the conclusion of a 32.4 mile long track.", "f_scale": 1, "wind": 110, "source": "NWS Storm Survey", "state_1": "LA", "state_2": "MS", "state_3": null, "spc_id": null, "ncei_id": "1172705, 1172721", "tornado_type": "Tornado", "storm_morphology": "QLCS", "sub_morphology": "Line notch", "satellite_scar": true, "tds": true, "tropical_cyclone": false, "last_certified": "2024-07-28T12:48:45", "satellite_needs_review": false, "storm_motion": 60, "storm_direction": 208, "vrot": 60, "nrot": 2.83, "meso_diameter": 3.17, "arl": 3810, "radar_distance": 52.68, "radar": "KHDC", "morphology_confidence_high": true, "tds_confidence_high": true, "satellite_scar_degree": "moderate", "radar_scan_time": "2024-04-10T13:15:52" }, "geometry": { "type": "LineString", "coordinates": [ [ -91.357292126, 30.834501218000014 ], [ -91.351103733, 30.845533268 ], [ -91.348803471, 30.850927238 ], [ -91.34561710700001, 30.860092405999978 ], [ -91.342573287999983, 30.86552190499998 ], [ -91.33318228600001, 30.876949610999986 ], [ -91.318119, 30.89109244399998 ], [ -91.310866307000026, 30.898420851000026 ], [ -91.296875904999979, 30.919077312000013 ], [ -91.263983091, 30.956470664 ], [ -91.252122659, 30.98018246800001 ], [ -91.24723031000002, 30.996811578 ], [ -91.234527367999988, 31.015203234000012 ] ] } },

One two story single family home on Oxford Pike had its roof completely lifted off and there was also visible exterior wall collapse on the second story of one side of the home. Winds here were estimated to be up to 110 mph, representing high-end EF-1 damage.\nOnce the tornado moved to Springfield Road, it appeared to have weakened. Minor tree damage was observed on Springfield Road and damage to a barn was seen on Raymond Road. The tornado then moved into Butler County, Ohio, at 2008EST, about 5 miles south-southwest of Oxford, and ended shortly thereafter at 2009EST. The tornado started in Franklin County, Indiana, at 1956EST, just to the east of Brookville Lake. The tornado moved east and entered Butler County Ohio, at 2008EST, about 5 miles south-southwest of Oxford. The tornado quickly weakened and ended just east of State-Line Road, near Springfield Road, where it caused some minor tree damage.", "f_scale": 1, "wind": 110, "source": "NWS Storm Survey", "state_1": "IN", "state_2": null, "state_3": null, "spc_id": null, "ncei_id": "1172537, 1172538", "tornado_type": "Tornado", "storm_morphology": "HP supercell", "sub_morphology": "RM cell in cluster", "satellite_scar": true, "tds": true, "tropical_cyclone": false, "last_certified": "2024-09-22T00:56:27", "satellite_needs_review": false, "storm_motion": 27, "storm_direction": 282, "vrot": 68, "nrot": 2.39, "meso_diameter": 0.99, "arl": 4640, "radar_distance": 51.47, "radar": "KILN", "morphology_confidence_high": true, "tds_confidence_high": false, "satellite_scar_degree": "weak", "radar_scan_time": "2024-05-08T01:00:50" }, "geometry": { "type": "LineString", "coordinates": [ [ -84.958652202999986, 39.462445103999983 ], [ -84.949554149999983, 39.463372806 ], [ -84.939037526999982, 39.467438494000021 ], [ -84.937342371, 39.46801826799998 ], [ -84.93665572499998, 39.468175633999977 ], [ -84.935572112999978, 39.468117657 ], [ -84.933930600999986, 39.467372233999981 ], [ -84.931859936000023, 39.466618520999987 ], [ -84.910415355999987, 39.46032459700001 ], [ -84.882091229000025, 39.451709371999982 ], [ -84.872887690000027, 39.448424597999974 ], [ -84.86842449400001, 39.446701344000019 ], [ -84.863360483, 39.44534259400001 ], [ -84.856172163, 39.444663209999987 ], [ -84.849992354, 39.444066670999973 ], [ -84.84535749600002, 39.443652405000023 ], [ -84.836881716, 39.444149524000011 ], [ -84.824114400999974, 39.445408875999988 ], [ -84.811268344999974, 39.447201321000023 ] ] } },

Large limbs were down across nearby roadways and minor roof damage was observed near this location. The tornado continued northeast and created some damage near Mullins Street and Withlacoochee Street. Damage here remained rated at EF-0 (approximately 70 mph). Power lines were wrapped around tree limbs and an electrical meter head had been detached from the side of the house. A large tree fell near the intersection and damaged a small fence. Additional minor roof damage to surrounding homes was observed. Large downed tree limbs were observed along McEachern Heights Street, 2nd Avenue, and in Amazing Grace Park.\nThe most significant damage occurred in downtown Marion along Main Street. A roof completely collapsed near the city center with limited damage to the exterior walls. Across the street, windows and window dividers were completely blown out. A wall on the second floor was pushed inward and its attached window and window seals were missing. An adjacent building lost a large portion of roof covering which fell to the street below. All debris was scattered in multiple directions.\nThe tornado continued toward the northeast and snapped tree tops near the intersection of Fairlee Street and Wheeler Street. Portions of roof coverings were missing from a few homes and businesses. Damage here was not as significant as on Main Street. Additional damage was not observed for one mile indicating the tornado was likely making contact with the ground intermittently. Along Luther Rogers Road, a trampoline that had previously been secured with large metal stakes was lofted into the side of a neighbors home two homes to the east. As the trampoline was lofted, it made contact with siding and solar panels of the adjacent neighbor before hitting the side and penetrating the vinyl siding of the neighbor two homes east.\nThe majority of the damage was rated at EF-0 and 70 mph, but significant damage downtown indicated peak intensity as described above. There was a lack of significant tree damage typically seen with tornadoes which may indicate that the tornado did not contact the ground for a long period of time.

This tornado largely stayed over the water as a waterspout, and it briefly came ashore across the Lake Palestine Resort just west of Highway 155. Numerous trees were snapped and uprooted at the resort, with several RV's flipped over, and multiple metal canopies at the marina completely collapsed. This tornado then moved back over water as a waterspout again as it shifted north-northeast, before moving ashore again across a small neighborhood behind the Lake Palestine Motor Inn. Numerous trees were snapped and uprooted, with at least one large hardwood tree having fallen onto a two story home. The tornado then crossed FM 3506 and into the Briarwood Bay subdivision, where numerous trees were snapped and uprooted (DI 27, DOD 4). It was here where the tornado was strongest and widest (480 yards), before weakening and narrowing as it moved across the northern end of the subdivision along the lake. The tornado then moved back over water again as a waterspout, crossing into Smith County at 709 pm CDT. A total of 6 injuries occurred with this tornado, but only 2 people needed transport to the local hospital. Information on the damage in Smith County can be found in a Storm Data separate entry. In Henderson County, this tornado was rated an EF-1 with maximum winds of 105 mph, and tracked for 2.69 miles before crossing into Smith County. This is a continuation of the Southeast Henderson County tornado. This tornado moved across Lake Palestine as a waterspout as it crossed into extreme Southwest Smith County into Dogwood City along Highway 155, where a few small trees were uprooted and multiple large limbs were snapped. This tornado and associated damage continued to narrow as it crossed Highway 155, but still topped a few trees along County Road 1170, snapping several large branches and partially snapping a power pole, downing a power line across Lakeway Circle. The tornado then lifted as it moved into an inlet along Lake Palestine just west of Emerald Bay. The estimated maximum winds associated with the entire tornado track from Southeast Henderson County was 105 mph, although winds in extreme Southwest Smith County were estimated near 85 mph.

Radar also showed a tornado damage signature due to lofted debris from the tornado as it was occurring. The tornado touched down along VA-714 Dunkard Church Road, a third of a mile west of VA-729 Eggbornsville Road in rural, northwest Culpeper County. Several trees were snapped and uprooted in multiple directions. The tornado proceeded east-northeast and crossed VA-729 Eggbornsville Road. In this area, two dozen trees were noted to be snapped and uprooted in multiple directions. The tornado passed over several homes and a church, but no structural damage was noted to these. The winds picked up and overturned a large shed with five occupants; these people were injured when the shed overturned due to the strong winds. Another smaller shed was also overturned. A resident reported seeing the funnel touch down to the west of the road. A drone video showed a path of damage that was approximately 100 yards wide.\nThe tornado continued east-northeast, snapping and uprooting at least a dozen large trees along VA-629 Settle School Road as it traversed a stretch of that road between Tolivers Forest Lane and Spring Hollow Lane. Several trees were snapped down as it crossed VA-632 Dutch Hollow Road. Tree damage continued to be in multiple directions, including opposite the storm motion. The tornado proceeded another two miles, but did not cross another road until the final property where damage was noted. In the 9000 block of VA-640 Monumental Mills Road, a two foot diameter branch of a large beech tree was snapped off, along with smaller tree damage from a southeast wind.

Trees were uprooted and topped, several homes had shingle and gutter damage. The tornado did extensive tree damage along Arnold Hill Rd, and lifted many sections of a 30x50 ft metal roof Barn. An anchored single wide was pushed off the foundation by 3 ft with windows blown out. Three homes had extensive roof covering material and shingles removed. Near the intersection of Hershel Davis Rd and Arnold Hill Rd, a large well-built 40x40 ft garage/barn incurred heavy damage with doors blowing out and half the roof gone. The tornado increased in width in the Beech Creek community to 400 yds. Dozens and dozens of trees were uprooted and topped and twisted, facing directions from the NW to SE. Several trees were on top of mobile homes and houses and a large metal roofing storage facility on KY-246 had 40% of its roof removed. Along Hazel Creek Rd off of KY-246, several garages and outbuildings had roofing completely removed, and there were large sections of roof peeled back and some removed at a chicken farm, as the width increased to 500 yds. Telephone poles were bent and snapped and a very healthy 12-ft diameter oak tree was twisted and snapped 5 ft from the base. Off of US-431 in the Beechmont community, along Green Meadows St, some large oak and sycamore trees were uprooted, falling onto multiple vehicles. Homes had siding, soffit, gutter, and shingle damage. There was a also a lot of straight line wind damage on both sides of the tornado of 75-85 mph for up to a half mile. The tornado was at its widest near KY-2270 between Gaston Rd and Little Hazel Creek, at 600 yds, with hundreds of trees down facing in all directions. There were power lines down all over the place. A one story house had its roof removed. Wind speeds of 90-100 mph continued all along Mud River Union Rd, with drone photography detecting trees uprooted in the rugged countryside, connecting the path into Butler County. Including Butler and Warren Counties, the tornado tracked 41.1 miles. Peak estimated winds in Muhlenberg County, and for the tornado as a whole, were 110 mph. NWS Paducah thanks NWS Louisville for their assistance surveying this tornado. This tornado is a continuation from Muhlenberg County, where the tornado initially developed before moving east southeastward into Butler and ultimately Warren County before lifting. In total, this EF1 tornado was on the ground for over 40 miles and 50 minutes across three counties. Please see the Storm Data submission from the National Weather Service office in Paducah for more information about the tornado as it passed through Muhlenberg County.\nIt was determined that a long-track EF1 tornado crossed the Muhlenberg/Butler county line near Mud River Mine Road, and then quickly crossed over Penrod Road and Arnold Ridge Road where it was at EF1 strength. Numerous hardwoods were snapped and uprooted along this road.\nThe tornado traveled eastward across Huntsville Quality road at EF0 strength, continuing to uproot and break off large limbs of hardwoods. As the tornado traveled eastward toward the intersection of Coal Road and Southhill Union Road some tree damage was noted along with the roof blown out of a medium sized outbuilding. This damage was noted as low-end EF1. The path continued more southeastward toward the intersection of Southhill Union Road and Givens Road where some more intense clustering of snapped, uprooted, and snarled hardwoods was noted. Luckily, no trees fell on homes in this area.\nThe southeastward path continued across Muddy Creek, before taking a brief eastward jog along Sandy Creek Road. From here, more intensity was noted as the southeastward track resumed and the tornado headed toward Kentucky Route 79, Russellville Road. Particularly, more intense damage was noted at the intersection of Russellville Road and Richland Church Road and points eastward where a steeple was knocked off a church, and much more intense tree damage occurred to a grove of hardwoods. Damage just to the south of this intersection on Dimple Road was determined to be straight-line inflow into the parent circulation. Damage along Richland Church Road was noted at 90 to 100 mph as numerous hardwoods were snapped, uprooted, and snarled. Some cars were damaged with trees falling on them, as well as some minor structural damage to homes and outbuildings.\nThe path continued toward Sugar Grove Road, U.S. Route 231, and Interstate 165 where trees continued to be damaged by mostly EF0 winds. The tornado then crossed into northwestern Warren County just south of U.S. Route 231. This tornado is a continuation of the track which started in Muhlenberg County and continued across Butler County. In total, this EF1 tornado was on the ground for over 40 miles and 50 minutes across three counties. To see information about the tornado as it passed through Muhlenberg County, please see the associated Storm Data entry from the National Weather Service Paducah office.\nThe tornado entered Warren County just south of U.S. Route 231, and quickly crossed Highway 231 and Interstate 165 after entering the county. Just east of that location, intensity again increased along a ridge at Highland Church Road and Sallys Rock near Rockland. Intense tree damage occurred with winds estimated at 100 to 105 mph. The tornado continued east-southeast through northern Warren County, crossing the Barren River several times and continuing to damage numerous trees. Weaker EF0 damage was noted along these points, with fairly sporadic, yet still tornadic damage signatures. Roads that were crossed included Halls Chapel, Jenkins, and Goud Lake Road.\nAfter the tornado crossed Kentucky Route 185, it entered a subdivision off Mount Olivet Road. Here, a home suffered high end EF1 damage as the roofing structure was completely removed and spread downwind. Some of the damage impacted another house downstream, severely damaging the side wall of the home. The main home damage alone looked to be EF2 strength at first glance, however it was determined that the wind was easily able to get up under the roofing structure on the northwest side of the house and this resulted in a total loss of the second story. Given that there were no other instances of damage even close to that strength around, it was decided to keep the rating at EF1 with estimated winds of 110 mph. Other homes were damaged by debris from upstream outbuildings, as well as some tree damage. Insulation spattering was noted on the back side of structures and vehicles, also indicating cyclonic rotation. An eyewitness also had a photo of what appeared to be a funnel. The tornado continued on Mount Olivet Road to the east-southeast for another couple of miles before lifting at EF0 strength near Girkin.", "f_scale": 1, "wind": 110, "source": "NWS Storm Survey", "state_1": "KY", "state_2": null, "state_3": null, "spc_id": null, "ncei_id": "1188013, 1189011, 1189017", "tornado_type": "Tornado", "storm_morphology": "QLCS", "sub_morphology": "Line notch", "satellite_scar": true, "tds": true, "tropical_cyclone": false, "last_certified": "2025-04-04T17:16:50", "satellite_needs_review": false, "storm_motion": 49, "storm_direction": 275, "vrot": 60, "nrot": 2.0, "meso_diameter": 1.85, "arl": 1905, "radar_distance": 28.94, "radar": "KHPX", "morphology_confidence_high": true, "tds_confidence_high": true, "satellite_scar_degree": "moderate", "radar_scan_time": "2024-05-27T02:50:15" }, "geometry": { "type": "LineString", "coordinates": [ [ -87.081330553999976, 37.189724575000014 ], [ -87.073004976999982, 37.185468048000018 ], [ -87.061290007000025, 37.176682475 ], [ -87.045032747999983, 37.171885922 ], [ -87.034639578999986, 37.16847549 ], [ -87.021292905999985, 37.166560399 ], [ -87.010564069999987, 37.165602835000016 ], [ -87.003783446, 37.163072071999977 ], [ -86.998976927, 37.160951637999972 ], [ -86.987218123, 37.154658386 ], [ -86.978377562, 37.153769080000018 ], [ -86.955975753000018, 37.144533361000015 ], [ -86.923153169999978, 37.136039929999981 ], [ -86.911566282000024, 37.134129163000011 ], [ -86.834147001000019, 37.134402867 ], [ -86.783506895000016, 37.113324700000021 ], [ -86.768400693999979, 37.120168905000014 ], [ -86.696646238000028, 37.108807187000025 ], [ -86.664202237999973, 37.090323642999977 ], [ -86.555197263000025, 37.085667817 ], [ -86.51245358, 37.074574844999972 ], [ -86.453573727999981, 37.072931304 ], [ -86.417868162, 37.067726521 ], [ -86.379930996999974, 37.050054989999978 ] ] } },

A well-built residence did receive damage at this location, but this was deemed to be mostly from portions of the barn and other trees flying onto the structure. From there, the tornado crossed Interstate 49, although tree damage there was not considerable.

There, on a short road just south of Polk Avenue, the tornado managed to throw a small metal building system (MBS) after the column anchorages failed. This sort of damage has potential to garner a rating greater than EF-1, but in this case much tamer damage immediately surrounding the MBS led the survey team to rate this damage point at just less than 100 mph. Portions of the MBS actually flew into a different property along Stonewall-Frierson Road and produced car and property damage related to the impact. The tornado only continued a little farther from this point and the last signs of damage related to the tornado were at a westward bend to Stonewall-Frierson Road on the north side of Frierson.

From this location, additional damage was located in the vicinity of the 16000 block of Darnestown Road (MD-28). Here, about a dozen softwood trees were snapped and uprooted, falling in differing directions. These downed trees caused the closure of Darnestown Road for a period of time. The tornado continued on the ground for about 0.5 miles, where additional damage was observed along and near White Ground Road.

A pair softwood trees, approximately 30 yards apart, were snapped and fell directly towards each other, evidence of a tornado. The storm proceeded towards Old Town Gaithersburg, depositing a large limb on top of St. Martin of Tours Church at the intersection of South Summit Avenue and South Frederick Avenue (MD-355). The housing development directly east of the Gaithersburg City Hall was particularly hard-hit, with seven houses being condemned from trees and branches falling onto them.

Weather spotters and residents reported a tornado touchdown in the vicinity of the I-95 and I-195 interchange around 8:45 PM EDT. This was confirmed with ground reports of several large tree trunks twisted and snapped in the vicinity of Riverchase Apartments along Selford Road and Deer Run Court. The tornado continued east northeast along a narrow path toward Friendship Road and Francis Ave. Multiple trees and wires were down along this route in a confluent pattern. The most notable was a large oak tree snapped midway up the trunk. The tree ended up laying in the north-northeast direction onto two cars and a house nearby. An additional large oak tree and its root ball were laying 500 feet nearby closing off Friendship Road. Beyond this point, the tornado continued east northeast between Francis Avenue and Ingate Terrace. Additional large trees were sheared off along with large root balls toppled. Numerous power and phone lines were down as well with BGE and Verizon crews assessing and repairing the damage. Similar damage was observed as the tornado moved east southeast toward Elm and Oakland Road. Several large trees were snapped midway along Elm Road, Huntsmoor Road, Oakland Road, and Ashbourne Road. Wires were down as well with one power pole twisted at its base at the intersection of Oakland Road and Elm Road.\nBeyond this point the path widened a bit with two medium spruce trees down along Oregon Avenue and several large branches along Carville Avenue. The tornado proceeded to lift and cycle as it crossed US-1 at I-95 and Potomac Avenue around 8:48 PM EDT. The storm continued 1.4 miles east northeast toward Halethorpe, MD where an additional touchdown was noted around 8:50 PM EDT. This was confirmed with several damage reports in the vicinity of the 3600 block of Commerce Drive and Washington Boulevard and Lansdowne Road. Multiple trees were snapped along a narrow path from the Home Depot over toward Alside Building Materials and Amazon HQ. The most notable damage was along Robert A Young Way between Alside Products and Amazon HQ. Four heavy overhead doors were blown out of the distribution warehouse along with pieces of the awning and roofing material removed from the Alside building. Several trees were also sheared at the canopy top within this same area. Additional large trees were taken down behind the LA-Fitness and Store-it storage facility along Washington Boulevard. After this point, the tornado crossed into Baltimore City. After initially touching down outside city limits, tree damage was evident from a distance along a small ridgeline that extended from the end of Hilltop Avenue to West Patapsco Avenue parallel to the B and O Railroad nearby. The tornado continued past this point, twisting and snapping the trunks of several medium to large hardwood trees along Nieman Avenue. The most notable damage was just before the tornado lifted at Overflo Warehouse LLC. Large pieces of the warehouse roofing material were peeled back along with pieces of flashing. Radar indicated the circulation clearing this point and lifting at the back of Nieman Avenue around 8:57 PM EDT.", "f_scale": 1, "wind": 105, "source": "NWS Storm Survey", "state_1": "MD", "state_2": null, "state_3": null, "spc_id": null, "ncei_id": "1174101, 1174102", "tornado_type": "Tornado", "storm_morphology": "Classic supercell", "sub_morphology": "RM discrete cell", "satellite_scar": false, "tds": true, "tropical_cyclone": false, "last_certified": "2024-12-30T11:43:01", "satellite_needs_review": false, "storm_motion": 30, "storm_direction": 245, "vrot": 27, "nrot": 1.01, "meso_diameter": 1.8, "arl": 3330, "radar_distance": 40.27, "radar": "KLWX", "morphology_confidence_high": true, "tds_confidence_high": true, "satellite_scar_degree": null, "radar_scan_time": "2024-06-06T00:50:24" }, "geometry": { "type": "LineString", "coordinates": [ [ -76.706318201999977, 39.234824818 ], [ -76.669681032000028, 39.251237541000023 ], [ -76.651570756000012, 39.25761793700002 ] ] } },

The circulation developed just to the south of Essex, MD shortly before 9:25 PM EDT before racing northeast and strengthening toward Martin State Airport around 9:27 PM EDT. This is where a notable debris signature started to show up on radar as the storm pushed north-northeast. This signature was confirmed with ground reports of fencing damage near a warehouse across from Martin State Airport, and multiple mobile homes damaged in the Williams Estates area as the strongest winds pushed through. The damage path was fairly narrow and short lived. Most of the damage included the removal of underpinning from several single and double wide mobile homes in the Williams Estates community. This included several mobile homes along Wagon Train Road and Roundup Road as well as Cowhide Circle. Carports, sheds, and a trampoline were tossed around the neighborhood as well.\nSeveral trees were also snapped and turned in several different directions along Roundup Road and Cowhide Circle. The most notable damage was between Dahlia Lane and Roundup Road. This where the height of the circulation looks to take place right around 9:28 PM EDT. Within this area there were two double wide mobile homes with significant damage. One of the mobile homes had underpinning removed from two sides of the building with the windows completely blown out and a shed tossed 50 yards in the opposite direction from its foundation. The resident who owns this home had roughly 30 seconds of video showing the tornado as it passed through. He recalled a loud boom which was most likely the shed being tossed from the foundation to the other side of the residence. Pieces of the shed and other debris were impinged into the side of the mobile home as well. The neighboring double wide mobile home was also missing a majority of its underpinning along with several shingles and shingle material off the roof of the structure. Strapping on both units appeared to be secured with no other distinct structural damage to be observed.\nBeyond this point, the tornado continued toward Roundup Road and Cowhide Circle where the path widened. Much of the same damage was noted, but to a lesser extent with underpinning and shingles removed from several mobile homes in the area.

Minor to moderate structure damage was reported by two property owners along Bug Creek Road before the tornado passed northward over the Whiteface River. Towards 5:18 PM, the tornado began to weaken and finally lifted off the ground. The last uprooted trees, 4 aspen, were last observed at the intersection of Comstock Lake Road and Melrude Road, 2.7 miles east of Cotton, MN.

At this location, irrigation equipment was flipped over, indicative of EF-0 winds of 75 - 85 mph.\nThe tornado continued northeast to NE 120th St., where an outbuilding suffered damage to its metal roof; the roof was not torn off. Nearby hardwood trees were toppled and large branches were broken off, including at the entrance to Sunshine Grove (the site of the Okeechobee Music Festival). The damage in this area was consistent with EF-0 to EF-1 winds of 75 to 95 mph.\nFrom there, the tornado traveled over mainly undeveloped land on approach to 45th Terrace and NE 224th St. Though no damage was observed due to inaccessibility, dual polarimetric radar indicates that the tornado remained on the ground during this period. Along 45th Terrace, the tornado passed over a portion of a commercial farm. At least two small homes suffered significant roof damage, and a semi truck and attached flatbed trailer were turned on its side. Again, this damage was of EF-0 or EF-1 intensity.\nThe most significant damage on its path occurred at the Pine Creek Sporting Club, which is north of NE 224th St. Here, three well-constructed wood frame outbuildings were destroyed. Two of the buildings were at least partially open-front. On two of the buildings, heavy duty posts were sheared off at the ground as the roof gave way. On the third building, some of the posts were ripped out of the ground as the roof was lifted. Debris was strewn a large distance northward from these locations. According to an employee, one UTV was tossed into a live oak tree. The nearby cabins were spared of all but minor damage. Many hardwood trees were either uprooted or large branches snapped. It was concluded that high-end EF-1 damage occurred at the Pine Creek Sporting Club, with winds from 100 - 110 mph.\nThe tornado continued northwest, passing over open pasture before reaching a stand of hardwood trees along US-441. Many trees along US-441 were snapped; at least a couple were snapped down at the trunk. This was also consistent with EF-1 winds.
