The tornado formed west of Franklin near Redland Road north of Highway 34 producing minor damage to trees. The tornado traveled east-northeast gradually gaining intensity and producing more widespread damage to trees and power lines along highway 34 west of Franklin. The tornado grew in size and strength as it entered Franklin and crossed the Chattahoochee River with winds around 130 mph and a path width around 850 yards. Damage in Franklin was extensive with several homes heavily damaged or destroyed. Two homes had roofs blown completely off and a large stand of pine trees was completely snapped or uprooted on the north side of Franklin. A large wall and the roof of a large industrial building on Mary Johnson Drive were ripped off. The tornado continued east-northeast from Franklin to the south of Highway 34 snapping and uprooting trees before crossing into Coweta County around 11:54 PM south of Highway 34 between Charlie B Johnson Road and Bob Wilson Road. A National Weather Service survey determined that an EF4 tornado with maximum wind speeds 170 MPH and a maximum path width of 1850 yards occurred in Coweta County. The Heard County tornado crossed into Coweta County along Bob Wilson Road and gained strength as it moved east-northeast crossing JD Walton Road and travelled up Smokey Road with trees falling on some homes. Wind speeds quickly increased to over 150 MPH, EF3 intensity, near Timberland Trail on the southwest side of Newnan. Many homes had major damage and one home had all but the back wall collapse. The family survived with no injuries by taking shelter in their bathtub. The tornado continued east-northeast crossing Smokey Road and Belk Road where it reached its maximum intensity of 170 MPH, EF4 intensity, as it entered the western city limits of Newnan. One home at the end of Fairview Drive had all exterior and interior walls removed. Four homes along Arlington Court north of Lagrange St were destroyed with one having all exterior and interior walls removed, but leaving a vehicle nearly untouched in what was the garage. As the tornado moved east of Boone Drive, it directly struck Newnan High School and the surrounding athletics fields causing broken windows and doors and extensive roof and structural damage. A portion of the second-story brick wall near the front of the main campus building collapsed. One man died after he suffered a heart attack while trying to reach his daughter's home in a heavily damaged neighborhood after the storm had passed and first responders were unable to reach him due to the large amounts of debris in the area. The tornado weaken from this point onward continuing into the southern part of downtown Newnan, passing directly over the county Justice Center and adjacent administrative building which houses the 911 facility. Extensive roof and window damage along with some interior wind and water damage occurred at the facility. Numerous homes continued to receive damage from winds and falling trees as the tornado moved east-northeast crossing E Broad Street and Greison Trail with 120 to 135 MPH wind speeds. The tornado weakened further as it crossed I-85, causing only minor damage to trees and businesses on the southern end of the Ashley Park shopping center and a hospital. The tornado did re-intensify near the Windsong and White Oak neighborhoods around Shenandoah Boulevard and White Oak Drive east of the Newnan city limits, with max winds of 120 MPH. The tornado continued east-northeast weakening again but still producing damage to trees and power lines, some falling on homes as it crossed Sullivan Road and Lora Smith Road before passing over the Thomas Crossroads area. In neighborhoods south of Andrew Baily Road and north of Highway 34, several homes received damage from falling trees. The tornado continued weakening with more sporadic damage to several trees as it continued east-northeast crossing Fisher Road and Minix Road and moving into Fayette County. A National Weather Service survey determined that an EF0 tornado with maximum wind speeds 75 MPH and a maximum path width of 800 yards occurred in Fayette County. The Heard-Coweta County tornado moved east-northeast into Fayette County and northern Peachtree City crossing Line Creek east of Minix Road. It snapped a few trees near MacDuff Parkway where new homes were being constructed. Portable restrooms and light construction materials were also blown around. A few trees were downed on the CSX railroad tracks near Senoia Road and along Highway 74 near Kedron Drive. Large trees blocked the entrance to the Kedron Hills neighborhood at Loring Lane and Peachtree Parkway. The tornado finally ended near Astoria Lane at the northeast end of Kedron Hills in Peachtree City.", "Source": "NWS Storm Survey" }, "geometry": { "type": "LineString", "coordinates": [ [ -85.189520906, 33.253278358 ], [ -85.153729508, 33.259379133 ], [ -85.121175619, 33.27357768 ], [ -85.093709799, 33.284771467 ], [ -85.046846243, 33.300985561 ], [ -84.998094412, 33.313610379 ], [ -84.960672232, 33.317196641 ], [ -84.900762411, 33.327380822 ], [ -84.883252951, 33.332974443 ], [ -84.859907004, 33.345451227 ], [ -84.835359427, 33.358499743 ], [ -84.829229686, 33.361277677 ], [ -84.823707911, 33.363488013 ], [ -84.816605422, 33.365136768 ], [ -84.80837998, 33.367024434 ], [ -84.794332358, 33.37082951 ], [ -84.774591299, 33.37670704 ], [ -84.753305289, 33.384017559 ], [ -84.729272696, 33.392617383 ], [ -84.686229906, 33.405512067 ], [ -84.683236561, 33.406986871 ], [ -84.680239639, 33.408082509 ], [ -84.648528776, 33.415056055 ], [ -84.626148424, 33.422629003 ], [ -84.602630816, 33.431057869 ], [ -84.596039735, 33.434949676 ], [ -84.579070293, 33.440569208 ], [ -84.570465765, 33.443066992 ], [ -84.562417838, 33.44548759 ] ] } },

The tornado gradually strengthened, and destroyed a farm tractor storage building along Highway 135 northwest of Lake City. The tornado possibly weakened slightly as it crossed the St. Francis River area, but re-strengthened as it approached Monette. Northern and northwestern portions of Monette suffered significant damage. Homes and retail facilities had their roofs partially or completely removed, and the roof of a nursing home partially collapsed. One fatality and at least 5 injuries occurred in the nursing home. After leaving Monette, the tornado struck the northern portions of Leachville, in northwestern Mississippi County. Several homes suffered partial or complete roof loss in northwestern Leachville. A restaurant, store, and cotton gin suffered considerable damage along Highway 77, and numerous power poles were snapped. A fatality occurred in the store. Anchors to the store`s metal frame were pulled out of the concrete foundation. The tornado`s path was estimated at nearly a mile wide in this area. The tornado then approached the Little River area south of Hornersville, near the Arkansas/Missouri state line. A stand of trees was debarked east of Arkansas County Road 243. Several homes and mobile homes were heavily damaged or destroyed along State Line Road. Additional debarking of trees was noted. After exiting the Little River area, the tornado damaged six metal electric transmission line towers. Five of the towers had their top sections collapse, and one tower completely collapsed. The tornado seemed to reach its peak intensity as it moved into Pemiscot County, Missouri. A home along County Road 454 was substantially damaged. Farther northeast, near Highway J and County Road 407, two homes were completely destroyed with debris carried off to the northeast. A fatality occurred in one of these homes. Several vehicles, including semi tractor-trailers, were blown off of the road as the tornado crossed Interstates 55 and 155. Aerial and satellite imagery showed ground scouring marks in this area across the Mississippi River. In Lake County, the tornado significantly damaged trees with debarking southwest of Wynnburg. Homes and shop buildings suffered substantial damage north of Wynnburg. The tornado approached the Reelfoot Lake area and caused significant damage to a hotel, convenience store, restaurant, and camping facilities in the Cypress Point area. Three fatalities occurred in this area. On the southeast shore of Reelfoot Lake, the tornado damaged cabins and numerous recreational vehicles that were parked in a storage area. The tornado`s width was shrinking as it approached Samburg, however, it was still strong enough to damage homes, businesses, and city buildings in Samburg. Many homes suffered partial roof loss, and several mobile homes were separated from their undercarriages. The tornado continued northeast from Samburg, damaging several homes along Old Samburg Road. The last observed damage was west of Treece Road.
