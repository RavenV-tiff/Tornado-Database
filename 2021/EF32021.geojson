The tornado began along Chapel Hills Parkway, where minor shingle damage occurred. The tornado tracked northeastward across Ellard Road and directly over the Walker Chapel Road overpass on Interstate 65. It was at this interstate exit where the tornado began to intensify rapidly, snapping numerous power poles and causing substantial damage to a hotel. The tornado continued northeastward, crossing Highway 31, causing mostly tree damage along the highway. As the tornado moved into residential areas along Fulton Drive and Lykes Boulevard, substantial damage occurred with several homes being destroyed with at least one being swept off the foundation. There was also significant tree damage in the neighborhood. Several homes along Georgetown Lane suffered significant damage as wind breached garage doors, aiding in complete roof loss in some cases. Other damage included destroyed fences, sheds, and lofting of a hot tub. Numerous trees were uprooted or snapped.\nAs the tornado continued toward the northeast, it paralleled Carson Road and caused substantial damage to homes along Meida Circle, Darlene Drive, and New Castle Road. Buildings in an industrial area along Carson Road were damaged, including a fleet of vehicles at Hurst Towing. The damage along New Castle Road was widespread with a few trees debarked or snapped half way down the trunk, and debris from homes thrown considerable distances. The tornado began to weaken somewhat after crossing North Pine Hill Road, but still caused minor damage to the Fultondale High School and a wooded area to the east. As it continued eastward crossing Indian Valley Road, several trees were uprooted and a few homes received minor damage. Along Highway 79, dozens of mobile homes were damaged by falling trees in the Rusk Mobile Home Park. The tornado then crossed Highway 75 in Center Point, where trees and power lines were downed near the Jefferson County Multi-Services Facility. The tornado began to weaken further at this point, but still produced a narrow discernable track of EF0 damage just east of Center Point Lake, where trees were uprooted and minor roof and structural damage occurred. Nearing the end of its life cycle, the tornado turned northward before dissipating near Country View Court in the Arrowhead subdivision of Center Point.", "F_scale": 3, "Wind": 150, "Source": "NWS Storm Survey", "State1": "AL", "State2": null, "State3": null }, "geometry": { "type": "LineString", "coordinates": [ [ -86.825595373, 33.596518516 ], [ -86.81932256, 33.600333225 ], [ -86.814574083, 33.603335989 ], [ -86.810349304, 33.606918229 ], [ -86.808100198, 33.608536304 ], [ -86.806319211, 33.609626414 ], [ -86.805439446, 33.610019566 ], [ -86.804371349, 33.610492898 ], [ -86.802590362, 33.611672335 ], [ -86.801083539, 33.612843054 ], [ -86.800502683, 33.613402019 ], [ -86.799837495, 33.614027459 ], [ -86.798700239, 33.614831589 ], [ -86.79767027, 33.615796535 ], [ -86.796726133, 33.616707864 ], [ -86.794880773, 33.618155248 ], [ -86.792054645, 33.620410386 ], [ -86.790844035, 33.621375175 ], [ -86.790302229, 33.621857613 ], [ -86.789765787, 33.622398119 ], [ -86.787506922, 33.624826654 ], [ -86.785940512, 33.626872447 ], [ -86.784974917, 33.62755139 ], [ -86.783805473, 33.628364327 ], [ -86.781361344, 33.629929492 ], [ -86.777279072, 33.631670333 ], [ -86.771145358, 33.633079339 ], [ -86.759394503, 33.635871634 ], [ -86.747683384, 33.638758207 ], [ -86.740446585, 33.640819467 ], [ -86.73073818, 33.644355159 ], [ -86.721198256, 33.647509637 ], [ -86.704880889, 33.65123426 ], [ -86.699880442, 33.6524299 ], [ -86.697152931, 33.652849318 ], [ -86.692692916, 33.652491879 ], [ -86.687218823, 33.653358702 ], [ -86.684310117, 33.653954083 ], [ -86.682533103, 33.654001713 ], [ -86.68087332, 33.654375614 ], [ -86.677405516, 33.655300745 ], [ -86.672575488, 33.656112763 ], [ -86.670489008, 33.656786411 ], [ -86.669233336, 33.6583297 ], [ -86.66782017, 33.659782877 ] ] } },

The tornado strengthened to EF2 intensity as it continued northeastward into a wooded area where numerous trees were snapped. The tornado weakened as it crossed into Shelby County south of Shelby County Highway 13, continuing to uproot trees. National Weather Service meteorologists surveyed damage in northern Shelby County and determined that it was consistent with an EF3 tornado, with maximum winds near 140 mph.\nThis tornado originated in Bibb County and crossed into Shelby County along Shades Creek west of River Road. The tornado traveled northeast in a wooded area along the Cahaba River, paralleling County Highway 13. As the tornado moved into Helena, it caused shingle damage to several homes in the neighborhoods near Old Cahaba Parkway and Hillsboro Parkway. A house that was under construction also collapsed. The tornado intensified again as it crossed Buck Creek near Old Town Helena, snapping numerous trees and causing roof damage. A few homes near Cunningham Drive suffered partial roof loss. The tornado weakened as it crossed New Hope Mountain near Pelham High School, but intensified to EF2 intensity along Crosscreek Trail and Wilderness Road in Pelham. Roofs were removed from four homes with collapse of an exterior wall on two of them, with many other homes suffering varying degrees of roof damage. The tornado also caused several trees to fall on homes in the Chandalar neighborhood. The tornado weakened somewhat by the time it crossed Highway 31 but still damaged the roofs of several businesses and mobile homes while uprooting trees. It began to strengthen again after crossing Interstate 65, paralleling Highway 119 through the south side of Indian Springs Village and far northern portions of Oak Mountain State Park. It continued to uproot or snap numerous trees and continued to cause roof damage to residences. Pockets of EF2 damage were found in neighborhoods south of Heardmont Park and near Oak Mountain Elementary and Intermediate Schools, with significant damage to residences from falling trees and partial roof loss. Significant timber damage with some damage to structures was also noted near the lakes at the north gate to Oak Mountain State Park. The most significant structural damage along the path occurred in the Eagle Point neighborhood just before Highway 280. Several homes suffered complete roof loss, a couple homes suffered collapse of exterior walls, and all walls collapsed for one home on Eagle Valley Drive. The majority of the other homes in the path in this neighborhood suffered varying degrees of roof damage, with numerous trees snapped. After crossing Highway 280, the tornado continued to uproot numerous trees as it moved over Oak Mountain. It caused roof damage along Highland View Drive and in the Highland Lakes neighborhood, including complete roof loss to a residence on Grove Park Way. Varying degrees of roof damage also occurred in the Greystone Farms neighborhood, with significant roof loss on several homes. The tornado crossed Dunnavant Valley Road and caused significant timber damage at Shoal Creek Country Club, and complete roof loss for another residence. The tornado then moved into a wooded area as it crossed Double Oak Mountain, continuing to uproot numerous trees. It crossed Highway 25 near Vandiver and then began to parallel Shelby County Highway 43, causing roof damage to residences and completely destroying a manufactured home on Crabapple Lane.

The tornado then produced extensive damage in the Macon community, destroying numerous mobile homes with moderate to major damage to several site built homes. In this area, tree damage was also extensive with numerous hardwoods snapped near the base along Ragan Chapel Road. As the tornado approached Highway 77, it reached its maximum intensity and was likely multi-vortex in nature based on the damage pattern. Here, a large swath of trees were snapped. A large factory, Precision Materials, sustained major damage. The entire structure and supporting frame of this large well built metal building was collapsed and bent inward. The owner said they received the tornado warning and moved all employees into a safe shelter in the interior of the building before the tornado hit. None of the occupants were injured. A large tractor trailer at this location was also partially lofted and then dragged 60 feet. The damage at this location was rated EF-3 . The tornado crossed County Road 77, with damage to several homes along Ragans Chapel Road. At least two homes sustained significant damage with most of their roof removed and windows blown out. A large farm building was also demolished. Ragans Chapel UMC, a structure dating back to the late 1800s, sustained major damage with most walls collapsed. The caretaker's home behind the church sustained major damage.\nAlong Mudd Street, several mobile homes were completely destroyed. A fatality occurred in one unanchored tiny home when the structure completely collapsed. Additional site built homes in the area from Mudd Street to Lost Creek Road sustained significant damage.

It is estimated that the tornado had a 98 minute life span, with a path length near 80 miles. It is impossible to know the exact number, but tens of thousands of trees were snapped or uprooted. The volume and extent of snapped trees pushed the rating to EF-3, around 150 mph. Along the tornados path, hundreds of residences were damaged or destroyed, either directly by wind or due to fallen trees.\nThe tornado began along Highway 17 just south of the town of Sawyerville. The tornado rapidly gained strength and widened as it neared and crossed Highway 14. Across Hale County, a large swath of hardwood and softwood trees were uprooted. Some debarking of trees was observed just south of Highway 14, probably from high velocity debris throwing. Five large transmission towers were downed on the north side of Highway 14. These towers are rated for 120+ mph winds according to representatives from Alabama Power. It is unknown whether this was due to a domino effect or direct blowdown of each tower. Either way, a powerful tornado occurred. Residential damage included wall collapse, roofing torn off, shifting off of foundation, or total structural loss.

The tornado touched down near Southampton Road, Kelvin Avenue, and Trevose Road where it uprooted and blew down large limbs from a few softwood and hardwood trees. The tornado then moved into Bucks County, with trees uprooted at the county line. The tornado which began in Philadelphia County crossed into Bucks County, where it would produce the majority of its impacts. After crossing the county line, the tornado continued between Trevose Road and Peyton Street where additional tree damage occurred before crossing Lukens Street. The tornado then very briefly crossed back into Philadelphia County at the northern tip of Poquessing Valley Park where a few trees were uprooted. The tornado then crossed back into Trevose in Bucks County where it caused some minor cosmetic damage to some homes in the Beechwood Estates neighborhood and blew down several sections of vinyl fencing. Several small trees were also snapped or uprooted in and just south and east of the residential neighborhood.\nAs the tornado approached Somerton Road, it began intensifying and widening substantially as it moved into the Metropolitan Industrial Center. Numerous softwood and hardwood trees were snapped or uprooted in the SUEZ Water Company property southwest of and along Somerton Road. Five wooden power poles were snapped near the ground along Somerton Road as well at the northern end of the SUEZ property. All seven warehouse buildings in the industrial complex northeast of Somerton Road sustained at least minor damage, with the most significant occurring to the Northtec building. Numerous roof mounted HVAC units were shifted or blown off of a few of the buildings in the industrial complex. Open bay doors in the western- most building caused a non-load bearing interior wall to collapse. A sedan was lifted and flipped over in the Northtec parking lot and a steel flag pole bearing a flag flattened completely to the ground. The Northtec building sustained substantial structural damage where large sections of roofing material were removed. Additionally, numerous exterior paneling was blown off, garage bay doors were blown out, a few windows were blown out, and at least two large HVAC units were blown off of the building. Numerous softwood and hardwood trees were uprooted or snapped in the industrial complex and immediately adjacent areas.\nA cellphone tower adjacent to the industrial complex had all of the antennas blown off, but the tower itself did not collapse. Southeast of the industrial complex, minor cosmetic damage occurred to some homes along Carter Road in a residential neighborhood. Tree damage associated with the tornado occurred along Carter Road and Sussex Road north of Buckfield Terrace. This was the area where the tornado circulation reached its widest extent of around three tenths of a mile. As the tornado neared and crossed the Pennsylvania Turnpike (I- 276), an overhead roadway information sign was blown off and a portion of it landed downstream nearly a half mile away. Just north of the turnpike, minor cosmetic damage occurred to a hotel building where a tree was also uprooted in the parking lot. A large billboard was blown over just north of the turnpike and south of Street Road. A small utility building nearby had its roof blown off. The northern- most extent of the damage occurred on the Toscana 52 restaurant property where the tornado blew down some chain link fencing and uprooted a few small trees in the parking lot.\nThe tornado continued east-northeastward across Street Road toward the Faulkner car dealership complex where it began intensifying and somewhat narrowing its path of damage. The four dealership showrooms sustained significant damage where most windows were blown out and at least some roofing material was blown off. The most significant damage occurred to the Buick/GMC showroom where most of the roofing material was blown off, all windows and doors were blown out, and exterior walls exhibited fracturing due to stress from the wind. Roof HVAC units of this building were tossed into the parking lot behind the building. All of the dealership signs near the main road were destroyed. Scores of new and used vehicles sustained significant damage from flying debris or from being pushed or tossed trough the air.\nThe tornado continued toward the dealership's main service garage where the most significant damage occurred. The southwestern portion of the building was destroyed with most exterior walls collapsing completely and all roofing material blown off. Interior walls mostly remained standing. Roof HVAC units were tossed off of the building with one unit landing nearly 200 yards downstream of the building. Damage sustained to the building decreased somewhat toward the eastern end of it where portions of the exterior walls were damaged and almost all garage bay doors were blown out. The wind rushing through the garage area carried debris, car parts, and tools well away from the structure downstream. Some vehicles near the main garage building were completely destroyed from large pieces of flying debris or from being tossed and dropped back onto the ground. A small pickup truck was crushed from a collapsed exterior wall. Five people reportedly sustained minor injuries at the dealership complex.\nThe tornado continued east-northeast toward the Weisser Homes mobile home park and into an area of trees which sustained significant damage. Most tree canopies and limbs were completely stripped from the still standing or snapped trunks of hardwood trees in this area. A large storage container filled with car parts from the service garage parking lot upstream was lofted into the air and dropped into this area of trees. An uninhabited mobile home model was lifted and completely destroyed at the mobile home park. Another double-wide mobile home had a large portion of its roof blown off. Several other mobile home sustained varying degrees of damage as well. A large amount of various debris from the dealership complex landed in this mobile home park. Numerous softwood and hardwood trees near and just downstream of this area were snapped or uprooted along Old Lincoln Highway.\nAt this stage, the tornado damage path narrowed considerably and intensity weakened significantly as it crossed Old Lincoln Highway and moved toward the Lowe's and Walmart shopping centers on Route 1. The tornado passed over these shopping centers, but no structural damage was noted to these structures. Numerous small trees were snapped and uprooted in the large parking lot area and line of trees just north of the Bensalem turnpike interchange. Some exit ramp signs were blown down in the interchange area.\nThe tornado damage became somewhat discontinuous as it continued east-southeast into Bensalem across Route 1 and toward a residential neighborhood. Several homes in the neighborhood sustained loss of some roofing material and other cosmetic damage in addition to some tree damage. The tornado continued across Rockhill Road and along Richlieu Road toward the Christian Life Center where several trees were snapped or uprooted. The church's steeple had some paneling blown off, but the steeple itself was not damaged otherwise. The tornado continued weakening as it crossed Galloway Road then dissipated in the Bensalem Township Community Park where some minor tree damage occurred.\nNo known serious injuries or fatalities occurred from this tornado.", "F_scale": 3, "Wind": 140, "Source": "NWS Storm Survey", "State1": "PA", "State2": null, "State3": null }, "geometry": { "type": "LineString", "coordinates": [ [ -75.00517431, 40.129580275 ], [ -75.00029269, 40.131106043 ], [ -74.993726642, 40.131786885 ], [ -74.982935385, 40.133419239 ], [ -74.977442221, 40.134206692 ], [ -74.974028499, 40.134961326 ], [ -74.969736964, 40.135240211 ], [ -74.940747649, 40.13012168 ] ] } },

As it moved to the northeast, it crossed into the Cedar Grove area producing more significant damage to trees with many trees uprooted.\nThe tornado moved into the Willow Oaks subdivision strengthening further and producing significant damage to trees, as well as serious structural damage to a number of homes. Several homes had exterior walls completely collapsed, a number of homes lost roofs and upper story walls, and one home had only a few interior walls remaining. Vehicles were tossed around and moved, and damage from flying debris was observed in several spots.\nThe tornado continued to move to the northeast to Bridgeton Pike where multiple trees had trunks snapped and most of the barns and storage buildings at a large commercial farm were completely destroyed. The tornado also reached its maximum width at this location and was estimated to be around 400 yards wide.\nThe tornado then continued northeast through the woods with multiple trees snapped before entering the subdivision at Salvatore Drive. Here the tornado's most significant damage was observed with one home completely destroyed with no interior or exterior walls standing. Other homes in the subdivision had exterior walls collapsed along with garage collapses and vehicles being tossed around by the tornadic winds. The consistency of the damage along the path of the tornado in this area was EF-3 in the middle of the circulation, with EF-2 along the edge of the circulation. In addition, the tree damage was not as extensive behind the completely destroyed house. Based on the consistency of the damage along Salvatore Drive, a rating of EF-3 (150 mph) was determined.\nThe tornado continued to the northeast damaging trees and structures along its path before reaching a large commercial dairy farm where extensive damage occurred. Barns were destroyed and two large grain silos were toppled. The tornado then crossed Jefferson Road and crossed Eachus Road snapping multiple trees. Thereafter, the tornado moved into the Breakneck Road area producing complete deforestation with nearly 100 percent of the trees in a thickly wooded area snapped.\nThe tornado path crossed Main St, just south of Chestnut Branch Park in Mantua Township snapping and uprooting a number of trees before reaching the Delaware Valley Florist commercial greenhouse mostly destroying the structure. The tornado damage path then continued to the northeast reaching Wenonah, snapping and uprooting a number of trees, a few homes lost roofs and one structure collapsed.\nLess severe tree damage persisted to the northeast along the tornado's path toward Deptford where the tornado lifted.", "F_scale": 3, "Wind": 150, "Source": "NWS Storm Survey", "State1": "NJ", "State2": null, "State3": null }, "geometry": { "type": "LineString", "coordinates": [ [ -75.250626687, 39.676520356 ], [ -75.249103192, 39.677428683 ], [ -75.224577073, 39.701982005 ], [ -75.223418358, 39.704359267 ], [ -75.222560052, 39.705745966 ], [ -75.220306996, 39.708750383 ], [ -75.218762044, 39.711308988 ], [ -75.217538956, 39.713108207 ], [ -75.21455634, 39.717267691 ], [ -75.205694321, 39.726939173 ], [ -75.203891877, 39.728820498 ], [ -75.189729813, 39.745453139 ], [ -75.179816369, 39.753701967 ], [ -75.174966935, 39.758040455 ], [ -75.158401612, 39.781542716 ], [ -75.157114152, 39.783125738 ], [ -75.150762681, 39.790809472 ], [ -75.148402337, 39.79324962 ], [ -75.136187557, 39.816669812 ], [ -75.114102248, 39.825350936 ] ] } },

The tornado crossed U.S. Highway 67 where it topped, snapped, and uprooted trees. The tornado traveled northeast paralleling a portion of Possum Hollow Road where tree damage was extensive with numerous snapped and uprooted trees. Several homes along this stretch were damaged, primarily due to fallen trees. The tornado then struck a farmstead near a bend in Possum Hollow Road where it completely destroyed two outbuildings. Neither of these structures were well-anchored and damage was rated at EF-1. The tornado continued to the northeast snapping and uprooting trees. A homeowner with 40 acres of land along Knob Lick Road estimated that 60-70% of the trees were destroyed. Extensive damage was found near the intersection of Knob Lick Road and Old Fredericktown Road. Three homes in this area lost all or large portions of their roof with one home also losing portions of several walls. This damage was rated EF-2. Damage from the homes, a destroyed garage, and trees was strewn hundreds of yards to the north. The path width of the tornado at this point was just over 400 yards. The tornado then crossed Highway OO where the width was around 450 yards. A home lost part of its roof, a barn was damaged, and numerous trees were snapped or uprooted along this stretch. All of this damage was rated at EF-1. The tornado crossed Smith Road destroying several barns and damaging a manufactured home, and then crossed Busiek Road damaging a small barn, several farm outbuildings and totally destroying a large well built farm outbuilding. Damage in this area was rated EF-1 or EF-2.  \n\nThe 400+ yard wide tornado crossed the St. Francois County/Ste. Genevieve County line just north of Green Acres Lane. The tornado then traveled to the northeast crossing Route F multiple times as it traveled towards Coffman. Numerous trees were snapped or uprooted along this path, a number of farm outbuildings and barns were damaged or destroyed, and several homes suffered partial roof damage. The worst damage occurred to a home on Route AA just north of Route F. This home was completely destroyed. All of the walls were completely blown into the rear of the foundation and the roof was totally removed. Little anchoring was evident to the walls. One minor injury occurred to a male at the residence who found shelter in the pantry area; it was the only area that wasn’t completely crushed. Tree damage in this area was some of the worst noted with every tree snapped or sheared supporting an EF-3 damage rating to the home. Another home on McDaniel Road just north of Route F sustained severe damage. The roof was completely removed and a large portion of the northeast walls were removed. Little if any anchoring of the walls was evident. The tree damage in this area as well as damage to surrounding structures was much less than that found along Route AA. Cumulatively these factors lead to an EF-2 damage rating of this home.  Numerous power poles and trees were snapped along Route F as the tornado traveled to the northeast into Coffman. Crown Valley Brewing and Distilling suffered minor damage, however the building on the north side of Route F was heavily damaged, rated at EF-1.  A small building adjacent to the main Coffman Baptist Church was completely destroyed with debris blown into the main church building. There was no anchoring evident in this small building and damage was rated at EF-1. \n\nThe tornado continued to the northeast across eastern Ste. Genevieve County through heavily forested areas with limited access. Scattered tree damage consisting of downed or snapped trees and branches was found. The tornado then continued to the northeast into St. Mary. Just to the southwest of St. Mary snapped trees were found and a farm outbuilding along St. Marys Church Road was completely destroyed. Numerous trees were uprooted or snapped in St. Mary along with damage to 28 homes. The worst damage in St. Mary occurred along Church Street where one home lost its entire roof, and the roof was removed from a large portion of the St. Mary Antique Mall. This damage was rated EF-2.\n\nThe tornado continued to the northeast moving through flood plains and crossing the Mississippi River into Illinois just north of the Menard Correctional Center.  The tornado crossed Route 3 south of Lochhead Drive destroying a small barn, snapping or uprooting trees, and caused minor damage to several homes and a hardware store. Snapped or uprooted trees and downed power poles were found along the remainder of the tornado track through Chester with roof damage to several homes on Brenda Street. The worst damage in Chester occurred just northeast of the Palestine Road and Three Spring Roads intersection, where two farm outbuildings were completely destroyed. The larger of the two buildings was well-built with anchor bolts every 18-24 inches in the concrete foundation. This damage was rated EF-2. Further northeast, minor roof damage and the loss of the roof-mounted HVAC unit was found at the nursing home near Old Lodge Lane and Three Springs Road. The tornado continued to the northeast into Bremen paralleling and crossing Route 150, producing tree damage and minor roof damage to several homes. Minor roof damage to several homes, damage to several farm outbuildings, and snapped and uprooted trees were found along parts of Chester Road and Paradise Road. The worst of this damage was rated EF-1. The tornado dissipated around 1.6 miles northeast of Bremen, just west of Route 150.", "F_scale": 3, "Wind": 150, "Source": null, "State1": "MO", "State2": "IL", "State3": null }, "geometry": { "type": "LineString", "coordinates": [ [ -90.409529974, 37.704887987 ], [ -90.382986833, 37.718213995 ], [ -90.337324907, 37.737222036 ], [ -90.310202409, 37.749438914 ], [ -90.268660356, 37.764367916 ], [ -90.233298112, 37.773052494 ], [ -90.196219255, 37.781464706 ], [ -90.034170915, 37.834358284 ], [ -89.944220353, 37.876645862 ], [ -89.791441728, 37.939490205 ], [ -89.741316606, 37.973328048 ], [ -89.724837114, 37.98577645 ] ] } },

The tornado continued to the northeast along the river and began impacting homes as it approached Fredericktown. Here the tornado ripped half of the roof off of one home, rolled a manufactured home onto its side, pulled roofing material from another home, and continued to cause considerable tree damage. The tornado widened to about 1/2 mile as it approached MO Highway 72 from the southwest, damaging multiple homes and businesses. A business on the south side of Highway 72 is where the only known injury took place, where an individual was hurt climbing out of the debris after the tornado had exited the area.\n\nThe tornado strengthened as it moved north of Highway 72, completely destroying a number of homes. It was determined that the frames of these homes were largely only toe-nailed into their foundation, which precluded a higher rating than a low-end EF-3. The tornado then impacted the Black River Electric Co-op. Here the tornado ripped a well-built canopy from between two small warehouses, completely destroyed one of these small warehouses, and then completely destroyed a larger steel warehouse attached to the main office. The steel warehouse was very well constructed, with steel I-beams approximately 1 foot in width, bolted into the concrete foundation roughly every 20 feet. These beams spanned the roof of the structure and supported a thick, crimped sheet metal exterior. This is believed to be where the tornado reached peak intensity, with approximately 150 mph winds. The attached office fared notably better, sustaining mainly roof damage and the loss of several windows. The office was very well constructed, consisting of brick and concrete walls. \n\nThe tornado then crossed US highway 67 and continued to cause considerable damage. Two newly built self-storage buildings with north facing bay doors were completely destroyed, while a third identical building with south facing doors was damaged, but remained standing. Two more homes were also impacted in this area. The roof was completely ripped from one of these homes, though most of the walls, which were bolted into the concrete foundation, were left standing. Only a few interior walls remained on the second home, though it appeared that the frame of this home was only toe-nailed into the foundation. The poor construction of the second home, and the lack of hurricane clips on the roof of the first, precluded a higher rating than EF-2 in this area.\n\nAs the tornado continued northeast, it moved through additional residential areas, damaging several more homes and businesses. The tornado may have begun to weaken somewhat at this point, as the walls largely remained standing on most of these buildings. The tornado then began to move into more rural areas to the northeast of Fredericktown, where it caused consistent tree damage for several more miles, ripped most of the roof from one home, and completely destroyed a barn. The tornado may have briefly lifted as it moved into northeastern Madison County before coming back down and causing considerable tree damage along Madison county road 252. Along the Madison/Perry county line, the width was about 1/2 of a mile wide with numerous trees snapped and uprooted. The tornado then moved nearly parallel to county road 238. Here several houses and a hunting lodge sustained minor damage, mainly to roofs and posts to a porch. One barn and a small shed were destroyed along with numerous trees being uprooted and snapped.  The tornado continued on to produce tree damage on Highway 730 where it was only a few hundred yards wide and dissipated shortly thereafter.", "F_scale": 3, "Wind": 150, "Source": null, "State1": "MO", "State2": null, "State3": null }, "geometry": { "type": "LineString", "coordinates": [ [ -90.392144423, 37.542519593 ], [ -90.35437892, 37.560007746 ], [ -90.327256422, 37.572525926 ], [ -90.307558279, 37.579056315 ], [ -90.288804274, 37.583341571 ], [ -90.2771313, 37.587218496 ], [ -90.266144972, 37.590211072 ], [ -90.252412062, 37.598916061 ], [ -90.234215956, 37.606804079 ], [ -90.192201834, 37.62033416 ], [ -90.149758558, 37.633453949 ], [ -90.117185812, 37.640794581 ], [ -90.07693122, 37.650852788 ] ] } },

Multiple homesteads and farms suffered varying degrees of property damage along Highway F to Highway 94. Two homes were completely destroyed. The first home was 110 years old and did not appear to have any anchoring to the concrete foundation. The second home just 100 yards east of the first was swept clean to the subfloor, which was still anchored to the concrete foundation. One fatality and two injuries occurred at this location. The damage was rated EF3 with winds to 165 mph. The tornado continued northeast, crossing the Missouri River and Howell Island before entering St. Louis County in Chesterfield Valley. The tornado caused extensive tree damage along the river, a mere half mile from a large outlet mall. It crossed Highway 40/61/Interstate 64 east of the Boone Bridge causing minor damage to vehicles that were on the highway.

The tornado moved northeast, uprooting and snapping numerous trees along its path. Several homes had significant roof damage. The tornado initially produced EF-1 damage but while progressing northeast, it continued to strengthen to EF3 as it approached Dresden, TN. Several buildings and homes in downtown Dresden suffered significant damage or were completely destroyed. The tornado slightly weakened and moved northeast toward Paris Landing and eventually crossed the Tennessee River. 5 people were injured in west Tennessee. The tornado clipped the Fort Donelson National Battlefield area of extreme southeastern Calloway County, Kentucky where it blew down several trees, then crossed the Tennessee River into the Land Between the Lakes area of Stewart County and did massive tree damage to heavily wooded areas uprooting thousands of trees along its path. The tornado struck a well constructed single family brick home near Bear Creek where it took off the roof and top story. It then continued to travel northeast where it passed Indian Branch and Morgan Branch where it continued to uproot trees and destroyed some farm outbuildings, lifted the roofs off of some single and double wide mobile homes and completely flattened some barns and single wide structures. The most widespread and severe damage in Stewart County was between Indian Branch and Morgan Branch, to the south of Bumpus Mills. The tornado then continued northeast across the far northwest corner of Fort Campbell Army Base continuing to blow down trees before moving into Kentucky. The tornado received a maximum rating of EF2 in Stewart County, and 4 people were injured. The tornado passed just south of the city of Lafayette, Kentucky where it immediately struck a barn and knocked down several electrical transmission lines. The tornado tracked northeast over mostly open country before causing significant damage to several homes off of Boddie Road and Darnell Road. More significant damage occurred to several homes, farm outbuildings, and structures on Palmyra Road. A mobile home was completely demolished and significant roofing damage was done to a brick home on Herndon Oak Grove Road. As the tornado approached Interstate 24, mostly tree damage was observed with a few structures impacted as well. Once the tornado crossed Fort Campbell Blvd, additional damage to electrical transmission lines was observed including over a dozen wood poles snapped. The tornado continued northeast causing mostly tree damage before completely destroying four tobacco barns and damaging three equipment garages off of Bradshaw Road. Two other buildings were also heavily damaged along with multiple silos destroyed. Damage estimates were in the millions according to the owners for just this one farm. The tornado then took straight aim for the city of Pembroke where significant tree damage was observed along with multiple houses with roof damage. Once the tornado moved out of Pembroke, two mobile homes were completely destroyed with the occupants injured. The tornado then crossed into Todd County where mostly tree damage and damage to farm/outbuildings were observed. The tornado then lifted just before impacting the city of Elkton where straight-line winds became dominant.

It quickly ramped up to EF-3 (140 mph) damage \nover a swath roughly three quarters of a mile wide along Milton \nSharp Rd. On the southern side, a family was home when a 2 by 4 \nnarrowly missed the husband as the roof was being peeled off the \nmiddle of the house.  On the north side, a large dairy farm was \ncompletely destroyed. As the tornado continued north northeast, a \nwide swath of trees was snapped/uprooted along the edge of a \nforest on the southern edge of the vortex, while on the north \nedge, a well built home had its second floor two thirds thrown \noff. A male was in the other section when a 2 by 4 from the first \nfloor came up and got lodged in his mattress. Another well built \nlog cabin in this area lost its second floor roof. \n\nThe tornado then turned more east northeast in the Buena Vista Rd \narea. A doublewide manufactured home was completely destroyed here \nalong with several outbuildings on the property.  A male at the home \nreceived warning from family and heard the tornado approach, getting \ninto a bath tub in the middle of the east side of the structure. \nAfter it hit, the home blew into a row of trees and the male \nremembers grabbing onto a tree southeast of his original location.\nHe sustained injuries as medics had to get wood out of his legs. \n\nThe tornado continued over to Lakewood Ln where a boy was in the \nsecond story of house when the window imploded inward and moved \nthe bed he was in. After this, the storm crossed US 431, impacting\nseveral trees along Hwy 1040 with EF1 level winds. It then moved \nto a row of mobile homes along H.C. Johnson Rd. Two of these homes\nwere completed destroyed, with one blown into a row of trees \nsouth of its original point and another lifted up and over a tree \njust east of its original location. This may have been a \nmesovortex spinning around the main circulation. The tornado \ndamage was widest at this location, roughly 0.8 mile. On the \nsouth side of the tornado, a mobile home was completely destroyed\nalong Hwy 915 where it was spread out over the road. The resident\nwas a female whose father insisted she stay the night at his \nplace, with a basement, after hearing the messaging in the days \nbefore.\n\nThat same mesovortex may have been what caused the collapse of an \nelectric transmission line just east of Marshall Rd where there \nwas little damage to surrounding trees. Farther north on that \nroad a well built brick home had its roof taken off as well as \nthe carport removed. \n\nThe tornado continued to track along Hwy 79 towards the Chandlers\nChapel area where the Methodist Church lost its steeple and had \ndamage to several of the stained glass windows. A couple of homes \nhad major damage here. A resident said he had at least 20 minutes\nof lead time ahead of the touchdown. There was additional damage \nalong Turner Road and then 3 Poplars Rd. This survey ended soon \nafter 3 Poplars Rd.\n\nAnother survey was conducted in the far northeast corner of Logan\nCounty where a couple of long chicken barns were leveled. Aerial\ndamage surveys also indicated a damage swath that extended into\nwestern Warren County for a few miles.\n\nWe would like to thank the Logan County Emergency Management for \ncoordinating  the areas hardest hit and escorting us through this \nlong swath of damage. Also we'd like to thank the Civil Air\nPatrol and Jason Harper for flying over the damage swath. Review\nof those points after the ground survey were very useful.

The new tornado formed, as the northwestern \nWarren County tornado lifted, and this new tornado became the \ndominant twister which struck Bowling Green, first touched down in \nrural southwestern Warren County.  \n\nThe first touchdown was just south of the intersection of Wimpee \nSmith Road and Petros Browning Rd. This consisted of twisted, \nsnapped, topped and uprooted softwood and hardwood trees. The \ntornado was about 200 yards wide, with EF1 winds of 90 mph. \n\nAerial photography confirmed the tornado was continuous in this \nrugged area of southwest Warren County. The tornado increased to \nEF2, between 120 and 125 mph, doing major damage to several older \nbarns along Tommy Smith Road. It threw a 1700 pound cattle trailer, \n300 yards into a creek ravine.\n\nThe NWS drone showed a distinct narrow main funnel within the larger \nfunnel. This 30 to 35 yard funnel was clearly seen scouring the corn \nfield and produced the most concentrated damage. The narrow funnel \ncrossed Browning Rd and hit a well constructed house. The only major \npart of the house that survived was an interior bathroom and \nhallway. Winds were estimated at 135 mph, and areas outside the \nnarrow funnel had damage of 100 mph, and the entire overall width \nwas 250 yards wide. The survey team found extensive tree damage \nalong Van Meter Rd and Fuqua Rd and aerial photography confirmed the \ntornado was continuous in this rugged, mainly forested area. \n\nThe tornado did minor roof damage to some homes along Blue Level \nRoad of 86 to 90 mph but did more substantial roof and side damage \nto several barns, of 90 to 95 mph. Based on drone technology, there \nappeared to be two distinct areas of damage, and likely had a \nsmaller satellite tornado. There was extensive roof damage to the \nZomi Agape fellowship center with insulation thrown both downwind \nand on the upwind side of the building. \n\nThe tornado increased in speed when it was over Old Tramm Rd by \nRembrandt Court and Powell Road. One house on Rembrandt Court was \nknocked out it’s foundation by the garage attachment and slid about \n15 feet. Other homes were knocked down to just interior bathroom and \nhallway remaining, but there were some foundation construction \nconcerns. EF2 winds of 130 to 135 mph were evidenced in this area. \n\nSeveral houses were knocked down to the foundation, but there was \nsomefoundation construction concerns. In addition, farm equipment \nfrom a barn on the right side of Powell St was thrown directly into \nhomes on the left side of Powell Rd. \n\nThe survey team found significant house damage to dozens of homes in \nthe Creekwood subdivision. This included exterior walls collapsed, \nroofs blown off, foundations severely compromised, garages blown in, \ninsulation blown on all four sides of houses, and garages severely \ndamaged or destroyed. In fact, they were dozens of double garages \ndamaged, where one garage door blew in and the other garage door \nblew out. There were hundreds of powerlines and snapped power poles \ndown throughout the county.  \n\nTrees were uprooted snapped and twisted facing in all directions. \nDozens of cars were flipped, twisted, turned, and thrown into homes. \nThere was clear evidence of 2 x 4 thrown into the ground, like \nmissiles. Several splintered boards were impaled into vehicle \nwindshields, tires, and along the hood grills. Most of the damage \nwas rated EF2 from 115 to 135 mph except for 8 homes near Mossy \nCreek. \n\nThe survey team brought in engineers from WKU to look at 8 homes, \nwhich were wiped down to the foundation from Moss Creek to Mossy \nStone. Engineers helped in determining winds speeds were 160 mph for \nthese houses, a high EF3 rating. Tragically, several fatalities \noccurred in the subdivision area. The tornado was 250 yards wide in \nCreekwood, but increased to about 350 yards wide before crossing \nVeterans Parkway. \n\nThe tornado crossed the William Natcher Parkway and hit large \ntownhouses along Veterans Parkway. There was numerous windows \nshattered and some roof damage. One of the town houses was shifted \noff the foundation, but there were no bricks or other support on it. \nThe tornado crossed Russellville Rd hitting many business. \n\nAt Royal Motor Cars, several storage buildings were destroyed, major \nloss of roof panels at Cabreras Mexican restaurant and an auto parts \nstore. At Plumbers Supply company at 2321 Russellville Rd. The \ngarage was blown in and collapsed. The main building had a shifted \nfoundation, and a partial collapse of some exterior cinderblock \nwalls, tractors and trailers were twisted and flipped, and there was \nnumerous power poles snapped. \n\nThe Shell gas station had major damage to service station canopy and \nstore, as well as walls of an Enterprise car rental. The tornado \nincreased to quarter mile wide and went from EF2 of 130 mph, from \nRoyal Motorcars to AutoZone, and then decreased to EF2, 115-120 mph \nand narrowed to 1/8th of a mile with major tree and roof damage \nalong Lealand Street, Cedar Ridge, and University Drive. A fully \nloaded dumpster was thrown 250 yards. At Russell Road and Springhill \nAvenue, a Marathon gas station had its pumps destroyed, and most of \nthe exterior walls was destroyed. \n\nThe tornado missed Western Kentucky University by 225 yards, but \ndebris was thrown all over the campus including some impaled debris \ninto buildings. \n\nThe tornado went along 31W including doing significant damage to \nroof at Bobas lounge, a liquor store, and a smoke shop. This was \nestimated to be 110 to 120 mph, and tornado width decreased to 250 \nyards by Walgreens and Taco Bell.  \n\nThe tornado, appeared to be slightly elevated, doing mainly tree \ndamage, power poles, and house roofing and siding along Magnolia Ave \nand Nutwood St. It crossed Lehman, went along Covington, with wind \nspeeds mainly of 95 to 110 mph. The owner 708 Nutwood said, “ your \nwarning saved our lives, as our house was violently shaking, but we \nsought shelter and lived.”  Much of the tree damage was facing from \nthe northeast to the northwest. The tornado paralleled Cemetery Rd \ndoing roof and gutter damage along with power lines and tree damage. \n\nThe tornadoes speed and winds increased along Cherokee Dr. with \nroofs removed and large healthy hardwood trees uprooted. The width \nincreased to 300 yards and speeds to 105 mph with width of 225 \nyards. \n\nThe narrow 175 yard funnel, hit the Indian Hills golf course, \ntwisting, snapping, and topping numerous pines and cedars with winds \nspeeds of 86 to 90 mph. The tornado then crossed the Barren River \nand increased in speed along Old Porter Pike to EF2, between 111 and \n120 mph. Huge diameter hardwood trees were snapped and uprooted, \nincluding several very tall oak trees. There was also extensive roof \ndamage to some well built homes. It weakened as it approached exit \n28, doing EF1 damage of 90-95 mph to Hucks gas station and damaged a \nvery tall Wendy’s sign. \n\nOn the north side of 31 W, a fully loaded 18 wheeler facing west, \nwas knocked over and was dragged 15 yards to a northwesterly \ndirectly. Winds were increased to EF2, of 115 mph. At the Corvette \nplant there was significant roof damage, with metal sheeting, \ninsulation, HVAC units, and other debris thrown hundreds of yards \ndownwind. Light poles in the parking lot were snapped, One of the \nsecurity checkpoints at the Corvette plant was totally destroyed \nwith large sections of the building being thrown several hundred \nyards, and weighing over 100 pounds, striking several vehicles. \nWinds were mainly in the 110 to 120 mph range. \n\nThe tornado continued to parallel I 65, just west of the interstate. \nIt struck several homes at Bristow Rd and Friendship Rd. Most of the \ndamage was done to roofs siding and gutters and destroyed a well-\nbuilt greenhouse. Numerous power poles and lines were down and the \ndebris pattern was facing from southeasterly, all the way to \nnorthwesterly.  \n\nThere was some barn and tree damage near Kelly Road and the CSX \nrailroad crossing. Winds were 85 to 90 mph and width of 200 yards.  \n\nThe tornado really increased across the TransPark at Exit 30. A few \nmetal building structures at the peak intensity of the tornado \nsustained heavy damage. The middle building totally collapsed. \nAnalysis showed that building was well constructed, but the shearing \nforce from the intense tornado ripped the metal frame from the \nanchoring plates of the building. Analysis of the third building \nshowed the tornado had weakened some at this point, down to EF2 \nlevels. The WSR-8D showed a Tornadic Debris Signature downstream of \nthis area, which was was lofted to around 18 kft, right at the high \nend of EF3 of 165 mph. \n\nThe tornado weakened further downstream as it caused roofing and \nsiding damage to several structures and tree damage into southeast \nEdmonson County. Civil Air Patrol imagery helped identify the end \npoint of this tornado.\n\nThe National Weather Service would like to thank Dr. Jason Wilson \nand Tyler Baker from Western Kentucky University, who analyzed the \nstructural elements of our damage survey. We would also like to \nthank Dr. Josh Durkee, professor in the Earth, Environmental, and \nAtmospheric Science Department at WKU, along with many WKU \nmeteorology students, who helped for days after their final exams \nwith the surveys. Also, the Kentuckiana Volunteer Aviators flew a \ntrack to help confirm the tornado end point.\n\nThe National Weather Service would like to extend our deepest \nsympathies to the families who lost loved ones and experienced \ntremendous devastation to their properties.", "F_scale": 3, "Wind": 165, "Source": null, "State1": "KY", "State2": null, "State3": null }, "geometry": { "type": "LineString", "coordinates": [ [ -86.618462853, 36.9159161 ], [ -86.562844567, 36.944457994 ], [ -86.491433435, 36.968600479 ], [ -86.423455529, 36.985056876 ], [ -86.406289392, 36.988347728 ], [ -86.387063317, 36.999316208 ], [ -86.365090661, 37.009186486 ], [ -86.347924523, 37.012476295 ], [ -86.323891931, 37.022344865 ], [ -86.303979211, 37.042626233 ], [ -86.262093835, 37.07714691 ], [ -86.219521813, 37.090293512 ], [ -86.209908776, 37.09796131 ], [ -86.150880297, 37.115669941 ] ] } },
