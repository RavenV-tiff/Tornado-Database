The tornado occurred in a large cluster of storms that were generally moving east across Fayette County. There were multiple mid-level circulations evident on radar during this event. So while a single tornado path has been created, there may have been other smaller satellite tornadoes or vortices that caused minor wind damage in other areas of Fayette County that evening. Storm Chaser video showed a multi-vortex tornado on the ground near Swiss Alp and this discussion is the best conclusion we have on the path, width and strength of that tornado. Based on video, storm reports, and tree damage, it appears the tornado first touched down around 6:42 PM CDT just west of Hwy 77near the intersection of Hwy 77 and CR 956. Some minor tree damage was found in this area as well as power poles snapped on Hwy 77. As the tornado crossed Hwy 77, it became larger and multi-vortex as it moved northeast across open pasture and farmland. At approximately 6:48 PM CDT it caused significant damage to a cattle farm approximately one mile south of FM 1383. Metal roofing was removed from multiple cattle shade shelters, there was roof damage to the business office, and partial structure collapse and roof damage to the main covered building, and cattle working area. Several trees had significant trunk and branch damage on the property as well. Metal roofing material was found several hundred yards away. The tornado continued to move northeast and eventually crossed Berger Rd. Several trees were snapped along Berger Rd. and adjacent properties. It is not totally clear where the tornado dissipated as some sporadic minor tree damage was found farther NE by about a mile. Due to the weak nature of the damage, we elected to end the track just east of Berger Rd. at 6:52 PM CDT.

Drone video provided to the National Weather Service confirms the track and timing of the tornado, which was ongoing at the same time as a tornado just to its west. The tornado caused more tree damage near Highway 378 at Lake Murray between Rocky Ridge Road and Adams Park Road then moved to the northeast over Lake Murray.

The ground survey indicated several trees snapped or uprooted on Sassafras Lane. One of the trees fell on a home damaging the roof. The tornado then continued to move northeast crossing near the entrance to Dreher Island State Park, where it snapped or uprooted multiple trees. The tornado then moved north-northeast back over Lake Murray toward Lexington County.\nWinds were estimated to be around 95 mph with a path width of 100 yards. The tornado originally formed in Lexington County near Windmill Road moved northeast across Lake Murray and then across the peninsula near Dreher Island State Park in Newberry County.\nAfter moving across Newberry County, near Dreher Island State Park, the tornado moved back over Lake Murray and continued north-northeast toward Grassy Meadow Court and RB Baker Drive.

The first few miles of\nthe tornado track were intermittent, with occasional evidence of\na narrow track of damage and some substantial damage to\noutbuildings and trees. The damage became much more consistent as\nthe tornado approached US Highway 275 where it damaged several\noutbuildings, including destruction of a well-constructed metal\nbuildings with wooden frame. Security camera footage at this\nlocation supported the likelihood of this being caused by a\ntornado due to sudden directional and vertical shifts in wind\nwhich the removal of the roof and walls was completed in only\n1 to 2 seconds. The tornado track continued northeast where it\ncaused substantial tree damage, destroyed two sheds, caused minor\ndamage to homes and snapped numerous power poles.
