The tornado formed west of Franklin near Redland Road north of Highway 34 producing minor damage to trees. The tornado traveled east-northeast gradually gaining intensity and producing more widespread damage to trees and power lines along highway 34 west of Franklin. The tornado grew in size and strength as it entered Franklin and crossed the Chattahoochee River with winds around 130 mph and a path width around 850 yards. Damage in Franklin was extensive with several homes heavily damaged or destroyed. Two homes had roofs blown completely off and a large stand of pine trees was completely snapped or uprooted on the north side of Franklin. A large wall and the roof of a large industrial building on Mary Johnson Drive were ripped off. The tornado continued east-northeast from Franklin to the south of Highway 34 snapping and uprooting trees before crossing into Coweta County around 11:54 PM south of Highway 34 between Charlie B Johnson Road and Bob Wilson Road. A National Weather Service survey determined that an EF4 tornado with maximum wind speeds 170 MPH and a maximum path width of 1850 yards occurred in Coweta County. The Heard County tornado crossed into Coweta County along Bob Wilson Road and gained strength as it moved east-northeast crossing JD Walton Road and travelled up Smokey Road with trees falling on some homes. Wind speeds quickly increased to over 150 MPH, EF3 intensity, near Timberland Trail on the southwest side of Newnan. Many homes had major damage and one home had all but the back wall collapse. The family survived with no injuries by taking shelter in their bathtub. The tornado continued east-northeast crossing Smokey Road and Belk Road where it reached its maximum intensity of 170 MPH, EF4 intensity, as it entered the western city limits of Newnan. One home at the end of Fairview Drive had all exterior and interior walls removed. Four homes along Arlington Court north of Lagrange St were destroyed with one having all exterior and interior walls removed, but leaving a vehicle nearly untouched in what was the garage. As the tornado moved east of Boone Drive, it directly struck Newnan High School and the surrounding athletics fields causing broken windows and doors and extensive roof and structural damage. A portion of the second-story brick wall near the front of the main campus building collapsed. One man died after he suffered a heart attack while trying to reach his daughter's home in a heavily damaged neighborhood after the storm had passed and first responders were unable to reach him due to the large amounts of debris in the area. The tornado weaken from this point onward continuing into the southern part of downtown Newnan, passing directly over the county Justice Center and adjacent administrative building which houses the 911 facility. Extensive roof and window damage along with some interior wind and water damage occurred at the facility. Numerous homes continued to receive damage from winds and falling trees as the tornado moved east-northeast crossing E Broad Street and Greison Trail with 120 to 135 MPH wind speeds. The tornado weakened further as it crossed I-85, causing only minor damage to trees and businesses on the southern end of the Ashley Park shopping center and a hospital. The tornado did re-intensify near the Windsong and White Oak neighborhoods around Shenandoah Boulevard and White Oak Drive east of the Newnan city limits, with max winds of 120 MPH. The tornado continued east-northeast weakening again but still producing damage to trees and power lines, some falling on homes as it crossed Sullivan Road and Lora Smith Road before passing over the Thomas Crossroads area. In neighborhoods south of Andrew Baily Road and north of Highway 34, several homes received damage from falling trees. The tornado continued weakening with more sporadic damage to several trees as it continued east-northeast crossing Fisher Road and Minix Road and moving into Fayette County. A National Weather Service survey determined that an EF0 tornado with maximum wind speeds 75 MPH and a maximum path width of 800 yards occurred in Fayette County. The Heard-Coweta County tornado moved east-northeast into Fayette County and northern Peachtree City crossing Line Creek east of Minix Road. It snapped a few trees near MacDuff Parkway where new homes were being constructed. Portable restrooms and light construction materials were also blown around. A few trees were downed on the CSX railroad tracks near Senoia Road and along Highway 74 near Kedron Drive. Large trees blocked the entrance to the Kedron Hills neighborhood at Loring Lane and Peachtree Parkway. The tornado finally ended near Astoria Lane at the northeast end of Kedron Hills in Peachtree City.", "Source": "NWS Storm Survey", "State1": "GA", "State2": null, "State3": null, "SPC_id": 619758, "NCEI_id": "941339, 941340, 941341" }, "geometry": { "type": "LineString", "coordinates": [ [ -85.189520906, 33.253278358 ], [ -85.153729508, 33.259379133 ], [ -85.121175619, 33.27357768 ], [ -85.093709799, 33.284771467 ], [ -85.046846243, 33.300985561 ], [ -84.998094412, 33.313610379 ], [ -84.960672232, 33.317196641 ], [ -84.900762411, 33.327380822 ], [ -84.883252951, 33.332974443 ], [ -84.859907004, 33.345451227 ], [ -84.835359427, 33.358499743 ], [ -84.829229686, 33.361277677 ], [ -84.823707911, 33.363488013 ], [ -84.816605422, 33.365136768 ], [ -84.80837998, 33.367024434 ], [ -84.794332358, 33.37082951 ], [ -84.774591299, 33.37670704 ], [ -84.753305289, 33.384017559 ], [ -84.729272696, 33.392617383 ], [ -84.686229906, 33.405512067 ], [ -84.683236561, 33.406986871 ], [ -84.680239639, 33.408082509 ], [ -84.648528776, 33.415056055 ], [ -84.626148424, 33.422629003 ], [ -84.602630816, 33.431057869 ], [ -84.596039735, 33.434949676 ], [ -84.579070293, 33.440569208 ], [ -84.570465765, 33.443066992 ], [ -84.562417838, 33.44548759 ] ] } },

The tornado gradually strengthened and destroyed a farm tractor storage building along Highway 135 northwest of Lake City. The tornado possibly weakened slightly as it crossed the St. Francis River area, but re-strengthened as it approached Monette. Northern and northwestern portions of Monette suffered significant damage. Homes and retail facilities had their roofs partially or completely removed, and the roof of a nursing home partially collapsed. One fatality and at least 5 injuries occurred in the nursing home. After leaving Monette the tornado crossed into Mississippi County. Peak winds were estimated at 145 mph in Craighead County. After crossing from Craighead County into Mississippi County the tornado struck the northern portions of Leachville, in northwestern Mississippi County. Several homes suffered partial or complete roof loss in northwestern Leachville. A restaurant, store, and cotton gin suffered considerable damage along Highway 77, and numerous power poles were snapped. A fatality occurred in the store. Anchors to the store's metal frame were pulled out of the concrete foundation. The tornado's path was estimated at nearly a mile wide in this area. The tornado approached the Little River area south of Hornersville, near the Arkansas/Missouri state line. A stand of trees was debarked east of Arkansas County Road 243. Several homes and mobile homes were heavily damaged or destroyed along State Line Road. Additional debarking of trees was noted. The tornado then crossed into Dunklin County, Missouri. Peak winds in Mississippi County were estimated at 145 mph. The tornado crossed from Mississippi County, Arkansas into Dunklin County, Missouri near the Little River area south of Hornersville, near the Arkansas/Missouri state line. Several homes and mobile homes were heavily damaged or destroyed along State Line Road. Several vehicles and a boat were tossed or overturned. Additional debarking of trees was noted. After exiting the Little River area, the tornado damaged six metal electric transmission line towers. Five of the towers had their top sections collapse, and one tower completely collapsed. Several center pivot irrigation systems were overturned. The tornado then crossed into Pemiscot County, Missouri. Peak winds in Dunklin County were estimated at 140 mph. The tornado seemed to reach its peak intensity as it moved into Pemiscot County, Missouri from Dunklin County, Missouri. A home along County Road 454 was substantially damaged. Further northeast, near Highway J and County Road 407, two homes were completely destroyed with debris carried off to the northeast. A fatality occurred in one of these homes. Several vehicles, including semi-tractor-trailers, were blown off of the road as the tornado crossed Interstates 55 and 155, resulting in another fatality. An indirect fatality occurred when a vehicle struck a downed utility pole. Aerial and satellite imagery showed ground scouring marks in this area across the Mississippi River. The tornado then moved into Lake County, Tennessee. Peak winds in Pemiscot County were estimated at 170 mph. The tornado tracked along the oxbows of the Mississippi River between Pemiscot County, Missouri, and Lake County, Tennessee. Aerial and satellite imagery showed ground scouring marks in this area across the Mississippi River. The tornado tracked along the oxbows of the Mississippi River between Pemiscot County, Missouri, and Lake County, Tennessee. Aerial and satellite imagery showed ground scouring marks in this area across the Mississippi River. After traveling along the Mississippi River the tornado crossed into Lake County, Tennessee southwest of Wynnburg. The tornado significantly damaged trees with debarking southwest of Wynnburg. Homes and shop buildings suffered substantial damage north of Wynnburg. The tornado approached the Reelfoot Lake area and caused significant damage to a hotel, convenience store, restaurant, and camping facilities in the Cypress Point area. Three fatalities occurred in this area. On the southeast shore of Reelfoot Lake, the tornado damaged cabins and numerous recreational vehicles that were parked in a storage area. The tornado then crossed into Obion County, Tennessee. Peak winds in Lake County were estimated at 165-170 mph. The tornado crossed from Lake County to Obion County. The tornado's width was shrinking as it approached Samburg, however, it was still strong enough to damage homes, businesses, and city buildings in Samburg. Many homes suffered partial roof loss, and several mobile homes were separated from their undercarriages. A recreational vehicle in a mobile home park along Lake Drive in Samburg was destroyed, resulting in one fatality. The tornado continued northeast from Samburg, damaging several homes along Old Samburg Road. The last observed damage was west of Treece Road. Peak winds in Obion County were estimated at 130 mph.", "Source": "NWS Storm Survey", "State1": "AR", "State2": "MO", "State3": "TN", "SPC_id": 620732, "NCEI_id": "997127, 997128, 997129, 997130, 997131, 997132, 997133, 997135" }, "geometry": { "type": "LineString", "coordinates": [ [ -90.550186035, 35.787171492 ], [ -90.451309082, 35.842852295 ], [ -90.344192383, 35.900718894 ], [ -90.276214477, 35.932416308 ], [ -90.243255493, 35.949094056 ], [ -90.206863281, 35.964101019 ], [ -90.164720413, 35.982855713 ], [ -90.141717788, 35.994800825 ], [ -90.129701492, 36.002022573 ], [ -90.119745132, 36.008688214 ], [ -90.104295608, 36.017852552 ], [ -90.089189407, 36.024516855 ], [ -90.039407608, 36.040619928 ], [ -90.026361343, 36.045616764 ], [ -90.014688369, 36.050335707 ], [ -90.001985428, 36.056442154 ], [ -89.990312454, 36.06282566 ], [ -89.978296158, 36.071706199 ], [ -89.965593216, 36.080030794 ], [ -89.950487014, 36.089464269 ], [ -89.927827713, 36.101115822 ], [ -89.880792495, 36.125245687 ], [ -89.840967056, 36.146595818 ], [ -89.801828262, 36.16794014 ], [ -89.788095352, 36.175977404 ], [ -89.761916992, 36.189417194 ], [ -89.687759277, 36.229307309 ], [ -89.624587891, 36.258104189 ], [ -89.561845657, 36.287859041 ], [ -89.549142715, 36.294777149 ], [ -89.540141838, 36.300769848 ], [ -89.521945732, 36.313496585 ], [ -89.507800713, 36.322581752 ], [ -89.497844353, 36.327284038 ], [ -89.487716332, 36.331432878 ], [ -89.478103295, 36.334890076 ], [ -89.465400353, 36.339591619 ], [ -89.448749199, 36.344431146 ], [ -89.427978173, 36.350929467 ], [ -89.402114746, 36.359915612 ], [ -89.35902774, 36.376640904 ], [ -89.333450195, 36.386453244 ], [ -89.323322174, 36.390737117 ], [ -89.314395782, 36.397784266 ] ] } },

A home suffered roof damage on Woodland Mills Road and trees were uprooted north of Woodland Mills. The tornado then crossed into Fulton County and eventually intensified into an EF-4 as it approached Mayfield, Kentucky. Peak winds in Obion County were estimated at 75 mph. This historic EF-4 tornado was associated with a very long-track supercell that originally formed over eastern Arkansas. The supercell produced a nearly continuous tornado damage path from northeast Arkansas across western Tennessee and western Kentucky. The starting point of this particular tornado was in northwest Tennessee, northwest of Union City (see Storm Data, Tennessee, Western for information on this and other tornadoes associated with the supercell). This tornado crossed from Obion County, Tennessee into Fulton County, Kentucky about 6 miles southeast of Hickman, close to the communities of State Line, KY and Woodland Mills, TN. The tornado rapidly widened, becoming over a mile wide across northeast Fulton County. The primary impact to Fulton County was on the community of Cayce, where the tornado achieved a rating of EF-4. This community was the site of the only fatality in Fulton County. A 57-year-old male occupant of a mobile home was killed. On the southwest edge of Cayce, a house was demolished (DI 2, DOD 9). This demolished house was assigned an estimated wind speed of 170 mph, the highest in the county. A small retail building in the center of town was demolished (DI 8, DOD 8). A total of 61 structures were affected in Fulton County, with 21 of those totally destroyed or uninhabitable. A number of vehicles were thrown and destroyed, including some farm equipment. Nearly total tree destruction was observed in the Cayce area. The average path width was a mile. The tornado exited Fulton County into Hickman County in a rural area about 7 miles northwest of Fulton. This historic EF-4 tornado was associated with a very long-track supercell that originally formed over eastern Arkansas. The supercell produced a nearly continuous tornado damage path from northeast Arkansas across western Tennessee and western Kentucky. The starting point of this particular tornado was in northwest Tennessee, northwest of Union City (see Storm Data, Tennessee, Western for information on this and other tornadoes associated with the supercell). This tornado crossed from Fulton County into Hickman County about 7 miles northwest of Fulton, close to the community of Croley. The tornado was exceptionally wide as it entered Hickman County, becoming about 1.5 miles wide. The tornado track in Hickman County was over rural farmland, bypassing small communities. The tornado achieved a rating of EF-3 over far eastern Hickman County, along Highway 58 near the Graves County line. This is where numerous wooden towers carrying electrical transmission lines collapsed (DI 24, DOD 6). This damage site is where the tornado was assigned the highest estimated wind speed in the county, about 140 mph. On Highway 307, there were four collapsed metal truss towers for carrying electrical transmission lines (DI 24, DOD 6). There were several injuries but no fatalities in the county. About a dozen homes were destroyed countywide. A mobile home was destroyed (DI 3, DOD 9). Most walls of one destroyed house collapsed, except small interior rooms (DI 2, DOD 8). The damage rating of this house was lowered due to toe nail construction. A total of 41 homes were damaged in Hickman County, and 12 were destroyed or uninhabitable. Hundreds of trees were snapped or uprooted. The average path width was about 1.25 miles (2250 yards). The tornado exited Hickman County into Graves County in a rural area about one-half mile north of where Highway 58 crosses the county line. This tornado crossed from Hickman County into Graves County about one-half mile north of where Highway 58 crosses the county line, close to the tiny community of Baltimore. The tornado was about 1.3 miles wide when it entered the county. It varied from 1 to 1.3 miles in width as it traversed Graves County. The primary impact to Graves County was on the city of Mayfield, where the tornado achieved a rating of EF-4. This city suffered a devastating impact, in terms of both loss of life and property destruction. There were 23 fatalities countywide and many more injuries. On the southwest edge of Mayfield as the tornado entered the city, a candle factory was demolished (DI 23, DOD 7). At least nine workers in the factory were killed. The tornado continued northeast through the heart of Mayfield at 9:28 PM CST, averaging just over one mile in width. The downtown area was directly impacted, crippling the police and fire department headquarters and emergency communications. Residential neighborhoods both southwest and northeast of downtown were destroyed. Numerous businesses in the downtown business district collapsed. Several damage sites in the city of Mayfield received a wind speed estimate of 188 mph, the highest in the county. Many of the structures were historic brick buildings (DI 17, DOD 7). At least 1,500 structures were damaged or destroyed, including a couple hundred businesses. The Red Cross estimated that 730 dwellings were uninhabitable. A large number of vehicles were thrown and destroyed, including some farm equipment in rural areas outside the city. Nearly total tree destruction was observed. The first EF-4 damage in the county was noted at and around the candle factory on the southwest side of Mayfield. Near the candle factory, a house was swept clean off the concrete slab (DI 2, DOD 10). The last EF-4 damage points in the county were on the northeast side of Mayfield, including a nursing home (DI 7, DOD 7). After entering Graves County, the tornado intersected I-69 (formerly the Purchase Parkway) four miles southwest of the Mayfield city limit. A wind gust to 93 knots or 107 mph was measured at the University of Kentucky mesonet site 6 miles southwest of Mayfield. The tornado then closely followed Interstate 69 northeast all the way to Marshall County. The tornado crossed the interstate multiple times. The first crossing was two miles southwest of Mayfield, then again northeast of Mayfield just east of the Highway 131 interchange, and again at the Marshall County line. The interstate was blocked in spots by trees, power lines, and debris. From Highway 131 to Highway 301 northeast of Mayfield, the tornado followed the exact same path as the May 10, 2016 EF-3 tornado. Some of the same structures that were damaged in that tornado were destroyed by this tornado. The tornado exited Graves County into Marshall County along Interstate 69 (formerly the Purchase Parkway) where it crosses the county line. This tornado crossed from Graves County into Marshall County along Interstate 69 about seven miles west-southwest of Benton. The tornado widened to nearly 1.5 miles (2450 yards) soon after crossing into Marshall County. The tornado width fluctuated from 0.8 mile to nearly 1.5 miles during its trek across the county. The community most impacted was Cambridge Shores, a rather dense subdivision of vacation homes and some luxury homes on Kentucky Lake. This is the only location in Marshall County where the tornado achieved a rating of EF-4. This community was the site of the only fatalities in Marshall County. A 78-year-old female resident died in the hallway of her house. Another elderly woman died of a heart attack while trying to remove debris (indirect). There were numerous homes in Cambridge Shores that were levelled, including the loss of all walls (DI 2, DOD 9). Some homes were wiped off the foundation. Marshall County's highest wind speed estimate of 170 mph was assigned to the damage in the Cambridge Shores area. A total of 356 structures in Marshall County were destroyed or uninhabitable. Another 341 structures sustained light to moderate damage. A number of vehicles were thrown and destroyed, including some that landed in Kentucky Lake. Nearly total tree destruction was observed in the Cambridge Shores area. After crossing into Marshall County, the tornado path stayed over Interstate 69 from the county line to about three miles west of Benton. In this area a few miles west of Benton, a home was blown off its foundation and a few other homes were demolished (DI 2, DOD 9). The tornado narrowly missed the county seat of Benton, passing only a mile or two northwest of the downtown area. Where the tornado crossed U.S. 641 just north of Benton, a home was destroyed with the exception of some interior walls (DI 2, DOD 8). The tornado crossed U.S. Highway 68 about one mile southeast of the county high school, then continued on to Cambridge Shores. The tornado exited Marshall County into Lyon County over Kentucky Lake, about 1.5 miles east-northeast of Cambridge Shores. his tornado crossed from Marshall County into Lyon County, Kentucky near the Hillman Ferry Campground in the Land Between the Lakes National Recreation Area. The tornado crossed the Trace Highway causing near complete tree destruction and broke one wooden electrical transmission line (DI 24, DOD 4). The tornado achieved its highest rating of EF-3 as it emerged from Lake Barkley just north of Eddy Creek. Numerous homes were completely destroyed (DI 2, DOD 9) between the shore and Interstate 24 near Mile Marker 46. The damage rating of a house in this area corresponded with a wind speed of 150 mph, the highest in the county. The tornado continued to the county line producing mainly tree damage with occasional structural damage. A 98-year-old female occupant died of injuries incurred in her home south of Eddyville. In addition, 5 others were injured throughout Lyon county. A total of 141 structures were affected in Lyon County, with 45 of those totally destroyed or uninhabitable. Nearly total tree destruction was observed in the Land Between the Lakes area. The average path width was a mile. The tornado exited Lyon County into Caldwell County in a rural area about 7 miles east southeast of Eddyville. The tornado crossed from Lyon County into Caldwell County in a rural area about 7 miles east southeast of Eddyville. The tornado crossed the Princeton Golf and Country Club resulting in collapsed walls of nearby homes (DI 2, DOD 10). This is where it achieved its highest rating of EF-4. A house near this country club received the highest wind speed estimate in the county, which was 180 mph. The tornado crossed southeast of Princeton, destroying large sections of the University Of Kentucky Research and Education Center (DI 15, DOD 10). The tornado then damaged many homes and trees near and just south of U.S. Highway 62 (Dawson Road). Just southwest of the intersection of US 62 and CR 2619, the tornado took a more easterly path (or rightward jog), continuing to damage homes along U.S. Highway 62 (Dawson Road) (DI 2, DOD 9). Two of the fatalities occurred at permanent homes on Dawson Road. The tornado trajectory then shifted back to northeast (or leftward jog), after which it crossed into Hopkins County on the southwest side of Dawson Springs. There were four fatalities in Caldwell County, with 11 others injured, 3 critically. All four of the deceased were found outside their residences. A couple who resided in a mobile home were both killed between Princeton and Dawson Springs. In total, around 300 structures were completely destroyed. The average path width was a mile. This tornado crossed from Caldwell County into Hopkins County near the city limit of Dawson Springs, which straddles the county line. The tornado produced catastrophic damage and some fatalities in Dawson Springs. About two-thirds of the city's homes were destroyed, and about a dozen fatalities occurred. There were at least 200 injuries. The core of the tornado narrowly missed the downtown Dawson Springs business district, but a large residential neighborhood on the north side of downtown was destroyed. This neighborhood is where the tornado obtained its maximum EF-4 rating in Hopkins County. A two-story apartment building was almost totally destroyed. Only a few first-story interior walls remained standing (DI 5, DOD 6). This apartment building is where the damage was assigned a wind speed estimate of 180 mph, the highest in the county. On the northern edge of town, over a dozen duplexes suffered complete roof loss. All exterior and interior walls of one of the units collapsed (DI 2, DOD 9). Most of the single-family homes suffered complete roof loss and the loss of most exterior walls (DI 2, DOD 8). In a few cases, there was complete destruction of residences (DI 2, DOD 10). On Highway 109 on the northeast side of town, a large retail structure with a long-span roof was destroyed (DI 12, DOD 7). Nearby, about a half dozen other smaller homes and businesses were demolished, including the loss of all walls (DI 9, DOD 9). Once the tornado exited the Dawson Springs area, it crossed Interstate 69 (formerly the Western Kentucky Parkway) about three miles northeast of Dawson Springs. A clearly defined wide path of nearly total tree destruction crossed the interstate. A house near the interstate suffered the loss of the roof and most walls, except for a few walls of small interior rooms (DI 2, DOD 8). Where the tornado crossed Highway 112, a few single-family homes were demolished, including the loss of the roof and all or most walls (DI 2, DOD 8-9). The tornado continued across heavily forested land until reaching Barnsley, a small community between Earlington and Mortons Gap on U.S. Highway 41. Several houses were demolished, including the loss of all walls (DI 2, DOD 9). In addition, a train was derailed and a 55-foot tanker car was thrown 20 yards from the railroad tracks (DI 29, DOD 1). The tornado then continued through a long swath of forest before crossing Interstate 69 midway between Madisonville and the Western Kentucky Parkway. Hundreds of trees were snapped at this interstate crossing (DI 27, DOD 4). A number of vehicles were thrown and destroyed across the county. The total number of affected structures countywide was estimated near 1000. A little over 500 structures were completely destroyed. Nearly total tree destruction was observed all along the path. The average path width was a mile. The tornado exited Hopkins County across the Pond River into Muhlenberg County about 6.5 miles east-southeast of Madisonville. This tornado crossed from Hopkins County into Muhlenberg County at the Pond River, about 8 miles southwest of Bremen. The primary impact to Muhlenberg County was in and around the community of Bremen, where the tornado achieved a rating of EF-4. The Bremen area was the site of most of the 11 fatalities in Muhlenberg County. A total of 165 structures were damaged or destroyed, of which 84 were completely destroyed or uninhabitable. The remainder were damaged at least moderately. The majority of these structures were along and just south of Highway 175 from 5 miles southwest of Bremen to the community of Bremen. Several demolished houses in this area warranted a rating of EF-4. The destruction of one house warranted a wind speed estimate of 190 mph, the highest in the county and the entire track. One brick home on Highway 175 collapsed, and another was swept off the foundation (DI 2, DOD 9). A car in the garage was thrown across the road. A couple of poorly anchored houses were swept clean off the foundation within a few miles west of Bremen (DI 2, DOD 9-10). On the north side of Bremen, a two-story home was completely destroyed. The foundation was not swept clean, but all walls were gone. Much of the remainder of the path through Muhlenberg County was unpopulated woods and fields. There was a cluster of damaged or destroyed structures near the community of Moorman, near where the tornado crossed U.S. Highway 431. In this area, a couple houses were heavily damaged, but most walls remained standing (DI 2, DOD 6). A number of vehicles were thrown and destroyed countywide, including some farm equipment. Nearly total tree destruction was observed in the path. The average path width was a mile. The tornado exited Muhlenberg County into Ohio County on the Green River about 2.5 miles east of Moorman. See Storm Data, Kentucky, Central for information on the remainder of this tornado path. The tornado finally came to an end in Grayson County, Kentucky at Rough River Dam State Park. This is the first of five segments of this tornado in the Louisville, Kentucky County Warning Area. The tornado was at EF-1 strength when it crossed the Green River from Muhlenberg County into Ohio County. The tornado retained EF-1 strength through an abandoned coal strip mine, snapping hardwood trees, overturning a large section of coal conveyor belt, and downing steel and wood power poles. Rugged terrain seems to have affected the tornado at times as it fluctuated in width and intensity moving across A9 Road, to Matanzas Road, and approaching A5 road. It weakened to around the EF-0/EF-1 threshold and narrowed to 200-300 yards as it crossed A5 Road and A6 Lane, before rapidly intensifying to EF-2 strength over Chandle Loop and Highway 85. Here, a large chicken farm lost 5 out of 7 of its well built chicken houses. The foundations were swept clean. In addition, several homes and barns suffered major damage or total destruction. Hundreds of large hardwoods were snapped and uprooted. One well built house had a large portion of roof removed along with partial wall collapse. Max width in this area was around a quarter mile. The tornado maintained solid EF-1 strength and narrowed to a width around 300 yards as it briefly paralleled Carter Ferry Road, and then approached and crossed A7 Road. From here, a significant topography change occurred as the tornado crossed the Rough River and entered much flatter open farmland. Damage was noted to a grove of snapped hardwood trees near Johnson School and Mud College Roads. Then, several (6 or 7) large steel electrical transmission lines were either broken or bent across a widening half to almost three quarter mile wide width. The tornado had gained significant intensity up to EF-2/EF-3 strength as it slammed into homes and businesses along US 231 only about 1 to 1.5 miles NW of Hartford. On the west side of US 231, two semi tractor trailers were lifted, twisted, and thrown 40 yards from their original position, badly mangling one of the cabs. In addition, a barn was completely demolished. A small, brick office structure was totally destroyed only leaving one half of a wall and a few interior rooms, while completely wiping away the other half of the building. Winds peaked at an estimated 140 mph here. Across the highway a well built, and nearly 100 year old, brick two story home lost its entire roof and collapsed a couple of upstairs walls. Other homes, very large silos, small businesses, and a fertilizer storage facility were heavily damaged in addition to some very large and healthy hardwood trees being snapped, twisted, and snarled. The tornado maintained EF-2/EF-3 intensity as it continued northeastward, crossing the William H Natcher Parkway and approaching Highway 69. Here, more intense damage occurred along 69 between Utley Road and along Morrison Run. At Utley Road, 2 homes and 1 double wide trailer were completely destroyed, and a 4th brick home lost an entire roof and collapsed a couple of walls. Here, an amazing survival story occurred as the residents of the 3 structures that were completely destroyed hunkered in the bathroom of the brick home and rode out the intense tornado. Luckily, no injuries occurred thanks to the great decisions made by the occupants to find a sturdier structure to ride out the storm. A large barn was also heavily damaged here. The next set of homes downstream from Utley Road experienced very intense damage. Here, two anchored mobile homes were completely destroyed as their frames were tossed and bent. One frame ended up 100 yards from its original position. A fifth wheel camper was thrown and landed upside down 30 yards from where it sat. A small farmhouse was also heavily damaged as some walls completely collapsed. Another survival story occurred here as residents made a decision to leave the area to seek better shelter. Many compliments were given to local television media coverage and warning lead time. Two more homes were either heavily damaged or destroyed as the tornado crossed Highway 69. A well built two story home lost half of its upper story, and a small brick home was sheared in half. Damage was observed by NWS surveyors to several hardwood trees along Morrison Run from Cedar Grove Road. However, the most intense tree damage of the Ohio County path occurred along Humble Valley Road where some local terrain influences very likely funneled the tornadic winds into a consolidated area. Here, strong EF-2 to near EF-3 winds snapped thousands of hardwood trees and damaged a few homes, barns, and sheds. It took 2 to 3 days to clear Humble Valley Road for access. A barn was destroyed, along with tree damage, and complete destruction of a home under construction along W Halls Creek Road. As the tornado continued toward the intersection of highways 878 and 919, it crossed Bean Hill doing mainly tree damage. It then did major tree damage, unroofed a home, and destroyed a barn at that intersection. Heavy damage occurred at New Baymus Road where a farm lost three substantial barns, and a deer farm was heavily damaged along with a bunch of equipment. Clinton Lane was the next to be hit as a brand new barn, power poles, and a few structures were damaged or destroyed. The barn was totally destroyed and thrown hundreds of yards downstream, and hundreds of hardwood trees were snapped. One cow was killed by flying debris here. Downwind of that, a trailer was cut in half amongst very heavy tree damage, and the occupants of the mangled half of the trailer had fled to a safer shelter. Hundreds of hardwoods were snapped around Cane Ford Lane along with total destruction of an old trailer. From there, the tornado climbed a ridge and crossed Highway 54, heavily damaging a home and garage, along with continuing to mangle hundreds of hardwood and softwood trees. The tornado finally came to an end in Grayson County, Kentucky at Rough River Dam State Park. This is the third of five segments of this tornado in the Louisville, Kentucky County Warning Area. As the tornado entered Grayson County, the path crossed the Rough River about 1 mile WNW of the Lafayette Golf Club. The tornado snapped several hardwood trees in this area before moving almost a half mile across an open flood plain. The tornado then continued northeast through a heavily wooded area, continuing to snap and uproot hardwood trees along the path. There some strong EF-1 intensity damage happened in a development area a mile north of the Falls of Rough State Resort where intense snarling of a cluster of hardwood trees was indicative of winds just over 100 mph. A well built structure was mostly spared as an inflow vortex fed into the main tornado path around the southeast side of the house. Extensive tree damage occurred in this area where over 100 hardwood trees were snapped and uprooted.This is the fourth of five segments of this tornado in the Louisville, Kentucky County Warning Area. The tornado finally came to an end in Grayson County, Kentucky at Rough River Dam State Park. The tornado continued onward crossing Highway 110, going over a ridgetop and snapping more trees. More extensive tree damage occurred as the tornado briefly paralleled another portion of the Rough River as it crossed Old Railroad Bed Road. The tornado finally came to an end in Grayson County, Kentucky at Rough River Dam State Park. This is the fifth of five segments of this tornado in the Louisville, Kentucky County Warning Area. The tornado travelled another 1 mile to 1.5 miles to a large boat storage facility on the Falls of Rough Road. The boat facility was heavily damaged due to winds easily tearing apart open boat storage structures. Large debris from these structures was scattered 300 yards across Falls of Rough Road and a runway. Power lines were also taken down along Falls of Rough Road. Damage ended just shy of the Rough River Dam Resort State Park on the western Banks of Rough River Lake.", "Source": "NWS Storm Survey", "State1": "TN", "State2": "KY", "State3": null, "SPC_id": 620750, "NCEI_id": "997426, 994038, 994194, 994196, 994199, 994954, 995882, 995999, 996014, 996991, 996995, 996997, 996998, 996999" }, "geometry": { "type": "LineString", "coordinates": [ [ -89.13499195, 36.483238637 ], [ -89.09387904, 36.511224248 ], [ -89.07276469, 36.526123699 ], [ -89.051650341, 36.542951111 ], [ -89.034655865, 36.554397174 ], [ -89.024012859, 36.560877929 ], [ -89.002383526, 36.573424227 ], [ -88.973544414, 36.584590096 ], [ -88.916209515, 36.614357853 ], [ -88.846858318, 36.651826836 ], [ -88.787806805, 36.677438517 ], [ -88.718798931, 36.701940638 ], [ -88.6648535, 36.729447028 ], [ -88.631938274, 36.744319121 ], [ -88.604815777, 36.759723681 ], [ -88.575976665, 36.775125147 ], [ -88.526881512, 36.800145931 ], [ -88.422511394, 36.841920664 ], [ -88.401912029, 36.856206784 ], [ -88.368266399, 36.874609965 ], [ -88.33599406, 36.887517014 ], [ -88.307154949, 36.904814529 ], [ -88.272479351, 36.917716471 ], [ -88.225444134, 36.936379247 ], [ -88.171542461, 36.959426957 ], [ -88.105624493, 36.990969059 ], [ -88.073352154, 37.008243102 ], [ -88.042453106, 37.026335509 ], [ -88.012240703, 37.04003901 ], [ -87.996447857, 37.043053448 ], [ -87.94323283, 37.063877206 ], [ -87.90581065, 37.078395655 ], [ -87.856414245, 37.099948049 ], [ -87.803843792, 37.124398028 ], [ -87.764018352, 37.143557437 ], [ -87.745822246, 37.156692514 ], [ -87.705996807, 37.165174371 ], [ -87.676127727, 37.178305693 ], [ -87.632525738, 37.195537088 ], [ -87.595790203, 37.213858226 ], [ -87.561114605, 37.228347916 ], [ -87.484896953, 37.258685227 ], [ -87.435115154, 37.28873718 ], [ -87.368167217, 37.313589272 ], [ -87.318042095, 37.331881717 ], [ -87.272380169, 37.349623863 ], [ -87.2064622, 37.374182991 ], [ -87.159770306, 37.392460678 ], [ -87.128527935, 37.401188748 ], [ -87.098365318, 37.40676912 ], [ -87.075912026, 37.412981661 ], [ -87.06844474, 37.414970605 ], [ -87.061286461, 37.416770312 ], [ -87.046695263, 37.420344022 ], [ -87.02443078, 37.426901364 ], [ -87.002805722, 37.433395103 ], [ -86.983755596, 37.437797771 ], [ -86.944934395, 37.454596739 ], [ -86.919528512, 37.465756489 ], [ -86.906482247, 37.4710292 ], [ -86.895839242, 37.475198059 ], [ -86.884492429, 37.479271323 ], [ -86.861932696, 37.487413543 ], [ -86.845868614, 37.493205936 ], [ -86.829612284, 37.4986129 ], [ -86.812858138, 37.504509724 ], [ -86.79131463, 37.511903926 ], [ -86.762492681, 37.524375726 ], [ -86.74561837, 37.531767958 ], [ -86.73530152, 37.534871662 ], [ -86.730392003, 37.536437079 ], [ -86.725705655, 37.538124968 ], [ -86.677606135, 37.555165059 ], [ -86.657556088, 37.560213736 ], [ -86.646106267, 37.562989681 ], [ -86.61943009, 37.575711435 ], [ -86.593389063, 37.587682865 ], [ -86.585870296, 37.589600837 ], [ -86.555520562, 37.597258623 ], [ -86.546868824, 37.598931536 ], [ -86.526938942, 37.603052447 ], [ -86.506425408, 37.6077171 ] ] } }
