Amateur radio operators followed up on a tip from a trained Skywarn spotter via social media and then uncovered many reports. We then spoke with Somers Fire Department officials, an eyewitness who observed the tornado, and viewed several online videos. The following information summarizes all of these reports.\nThe tornado touched down on Colonial Drive, then tracked to the north-northeast, impacting Lake Drive just south of Shady Lake, Kibee Drive, a portion of Main Street (Route 190), Battle Street, and ended in the vicinity of Hickory Hill Drive. This was a path length of 1.9 miles. The approximate path width was 75 yards. Damage photos led to estimates of maximum wind speeds of 75 to 80 mph, which put this on the mid to upper range of the EF-0 category of the Enhanced Fujita Scale. The time, based on radar, fire department logs, and an eyewitness account, was from 611 PM to 618 PM EDT.\nSeveral large pine trees were downed on Colonial Drive and two cars were destroyed by the falling trees. Approximately 19 trees were snapped, twisted, and uprooted on Lake Drive. A resident of Lake Drive heard a loud whirring noise and observed the tops of trees flying by the house. Shingles were missing on a house next door. A playscape was lifted up and landed approximately 50 feet away. On Main Street, a small corner of a roof was exposed, with additional damage along the length of the gutter. Farther to the northeast, a few large oak trees were snapped on Hickory Hill Drive.\nThis storm was low-topped and did not produce any lightning...only heavy rain.

One car port had significant damage from large, 4-inch oak limbs falling on it. Minor roof damage occurred, including shingles and large limbs falling on a few homes. One tree fell on a homeowner's pick-up truck, resulting in significant damage.\nMore substantial wind damage occurred at 10850 East Blue River Road. A large jacuzzi was picked up and thrown 10 yards. The hot tub was not full of water but weighed a substantial amount. Cedar trees were snapped and twisted and numerous maple and sycamore trees were uprooted, snapped and twisted all across the property.\nDrone footage showed trees going in multiple directions, especially from the north through southeasterly directions.
