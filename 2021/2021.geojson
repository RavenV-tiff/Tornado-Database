The tornado began along Chapel Hills Parkway, where minor shingle damage occurred. The tornado tracked northeastward across Ellard Road and directly over the Walker Chapel Road overpass on Interstate 65. It was at this interstate exit where the tornado began to intensify rapidly, snapping numerous power poles and causing substantial damage to a hotel. The tornado continued northeastward, crossing Highway 31, causing mostly tree damage along the highway. As the tornado moved into residential areas along Fulton Drive and Lykes Boulevard, substantial damage occurred with several homes being destroyed with at least one being swept off the foundation. There was also significant tree damage in the neighborhood. Several homes along Georgetown Lane suffered significant damage as wind breached garage doors, aiding in complete roof loss in some cases. Other damage included destroyed fences, sheds, and lofting of a hot tub. Numerous trees were uprooted or snapped.\nAs the tornado continued toward the northeast, it paralleled Carson Road and caused substantial damage to homes along Meida Circle, Darlene Drive, and New Castle Road. Buildings in an industrial area along Carson Road were damaged, including a fleet of vehicles at Hurst Towing. The damage along New Castle Road was widespread with a few trees debarked or snapped half way down the trunk, and debris from homes thrown considerable distances. The tornado began to weaken somewhat after crossing North Pine Hill Road, but still caused minor damage to the Fultondale High School and a wooded area to the east. As it continued eastward crossing Indian Valley Road, several trees were uprooted and a few homes received minor damage. Along Highway 79, dozens of mobile homes were damaged by falling trees in the Rusk Mobile Home Park. The tornado then crossed Highway 75 in Center Point, where trees and power lines were downed near the Jefferson County Multi-Services Facility. The tornado began to weaken further at this point, but still produced a narrow discernable track of EF0 damage just east of Center Point Lake, where trees were uprooted and minor roof and structural damage occurred.

The tornado formed west of Franklin near Redland Road north of Highway 34 producing minor damage to trees. The tornado traveled east-northeast gradually gaining intensity and producing more widespread damage to trees and power lines along highway 34 west of Franklin. The tornado grew in size and strength as it entered Franklin and crossed the Chattahoochee River with winds around 130 mph and a path width around 850 yards. Damage in Franklin was extensive with several homes heavily damaged or destroyed. Two homes had roofs blown completely off and a large stand of pine trees was completely snapped or uprooted on the north side of Franklin. A large wall and the roof of a large industrial building on Mary Johnson Drive were ripped off. The tornado continued east-northeast from Franklin to the south of Highway 34 snapping and uprooting trees before crossing into Coweta County around 11:54 PM south of Highway 34 between Charlie B Johnson Road and Bob Wilson Road. A National Weather Service survey determined that an EF4 tornado with maximum wind speeds 170 MPH and a maximum path width of 1850 yards occurred in Coweta County. The Heard County tornado crossed into Coweta County along Bob Wilson Road and gained strength as it moved east-northeast crossing JD Walton Road and travelled up Smokey Road with trees falling on some homes. Wind speeds quickly increased to over 150 MPH, EF3 intensity, near Timberland Trail on the southwest side of Newnan. Many homes had major damage and one home had all but the back wall collapse. The family survived with no injuries by taking shelter in their bathtub. The tornado continued east-northeast crossing Smokey Road and Belk Road where it reached its maximum intensity of 170 MPH, EF4 intensity, as it entered the western city limits of Newnan. One home at the end of Fairview Drive had all exterior and interior walls removed. Four homes along Arlington Court north of Lagrange St were destroyed with one having all exterior and interior walls removed, but leaving a vehicle nearly untouched in what was the garage. As the tornado moved east of Boone Drive, it directly struck Newnan High School and the surrounding athletics fields causing broken windows and doors and extensive roof and structural damage. A portion of the second-story brick wall near the front of the main campus building collapsed. One man died after he suffered a heart attack while trying to reach his daughter's home in a heavily damaged neighborhood after the storm had passed and first responders were unable to reach him due to the large amounts of debris in the area. The tornado weaken from this point onward continuing into the southern part of downtown Newnan, passing directly over the county Justice Center and adjacent administrative building which houses the 911 facility. Extensive roof and window damage along with some interior wind and water damage occurred at the facility. Numerous homes continued to receive damage from winds and falling trees as the tornado moved east-northeast crossing E Broad Street and Greison Trail with 120 to 135 MPH wind speeds. The tornado weakened further as it crossed I-85, causing only minor damage to trees and businesses on the southern end of the Ashley Park shopping center and a hospital. The tornado did re-intensify near the Windsong and White Oak neighborhoods around Shenandoah Boulevard and White Oak Drive east of the Newnan city limits, with max winds of 120 MPH. The tornado continued east-northeast weakening again but still producing damage to trees and power lines, some falling on homes as it crossed Sullivan Road and Lora Smith Road before passing over the Thomas Crossroads area. In neighborhoods south of Andrew Baily Road and north of Highway 34, several homes received damage from falling trees. The tornado continued weakening with more sporadic damage to several trees as it continued east-northeast crossing Fisher Road and Minix Road and moving into Fayette County. A National Weather Service survey determined that an EF0 tornado with maximum wind speeds 75 MPH and a maximum path width of 800 yards occurred in Fayette County. The Heard-Coweta County tornado moved east-northeast into Fayette County and northern Peachtree City crossing Line Creek east of Minix Road. It snapped a few trees near MacDuff Parkway where new homes were being constructed. Portable restrooms and light construction materials were also blown around. A few trees were downed on the CSX railroad tracks near Senoia Road and along Highway 74 near Kedron Drive.

The southernmost homes in this community were affected with minor siding and shingle damage. One homeowner with a personal home anemometer measured an unofficial 68mph wind gust.\nThe last two properties, those closest to 115, had the most substantial damage. One outdoor shed was blown from its foundation, and another shed was shifted from its foundation. The trailer section of a tractor trailer was pushed a few feet laterally, and then pushed over onto Route 115. The trailer was being used for storage. Leaf spatter was noted on the homes, and insulation and cardboard was lofted into the power lines along the road. The most substantial damage was from a west wind. However one property had lawn furniture blown in the opposite direction. Several large tree limbs were snapped in differing directions.\nTwo separate residents noted receiving the NWS Tornado Warning over their cell phones before the tornado hit, allowing time to seek safety in their homes. They also reported seeing the tornado moving into the next properties across WV-115.\nAs the storm crossed WV-115, several large branches were snapped off trees in front of Two Crows Antique Mall. While many branches were thrown east, a large one was also thrown to the northwest.\nThe tornado then struck a warehouse at Universal Forest Products and reached peak intensity. On this property it pushed over a large warehouse building that was partially opened along its sides. The main beams of the building were large timbers secured to the ground with bolts. The roof was tin and sections of that roof were carried a half a mile into an adjacent community. People were in the building at the time, but fortunately the only injury was a minor leg abrasion to one person. Another smaller warehouse building was also destroyed. It also caused roof and siding damage to at least two other buildings on this property.\nThe tornado weakened substantially as it traveled east from the warehouses. Debris, but not significant tree damage was noted along Foal Street. Some intermittent damage continued into the new Fairfax Crossing community where some minor siding and shingle damage was noted as well as a few small ornamental trees that were downed. Some final pieces of tin roof were noted here as well.\nThe tornado was witnessed to the south by someone in the nearby Potomac Marketplace shopping center as it crossed WV Route 9. From there it passed through mobile home communities along Grayrock Road and Cambridge Drive causing a few large branches to be snapped as well as some roofing damage to at least one mobile home.

The tornado occurred in a large cluster of storms that were generally moving east across Fayette County. There were multiple mid-level circulations evident on radar during this event. So while a single tornado path has been created, there may have been other smaller satellite tornadoes or vortices that caused minor wind damage in other areas of Fayette County that evening. Storm Chaser video showed a multi-vortex tornado on the ground near Swiss Alp and this discussion is the best conclusion we have on the path, width and strength of that tornado. Based on video, storm reports, and tree damage, it appears the tornado first touched down around 6:42 PM CDT just west of Hwy 77near the intersection of Hwy 77 and CR 956. Some minor tree damage was found in this area as well as power poles snapped on Hwy 77. As the tornado crossed Hwy 77, it became larger and multi-vortex as it moved northeast across open pasture and farmland. At approximately 6:48 PM CDT it caused significant damage to a cattle farm approximately one mile south of FM 1383. Metal roofing was removed from multiple cattle shade shelters, there was roof damage to the business office, and partial structure collapse and roof damage to the main covered building, and cattle working area. Several trees had significant trunk and branch damage on the property as well. Metal roofing material was found several hundred yards away. The tornado continued to move northeast and eventually crossed Berger Rd. Several trees were snapped along Berger Rd. and adjacent properties. It is not totally clear where the tornado dissipated as some sporadic minor tree damage was found farther NE by about a mile. Due to the weak nature of the damage, we elected to end the track just east of Berger Rd. at 6:52 PM CDT.

Damage consisted of thousands of broken tree limbs, hundreds of uprooted and snapped trees, shingles off and pieces of roofing removed from residences and buildings, many farm outbuildings either missing roofing material, walls damaged, and/or the building completely collapsed and removed from its foundation, windows broken out of houses, buildings, and vehicles, snapped power poles, overturned irrigation pivots, overturned semis and rail cars, and several grain silos blown over.\nThe tornado then proceeded to the east, exiting town and heading towards the Highway 83 and Highway 383 split. There were a few more irrigation pivots overturned, as well as power poles snapped. The tornado appeared to dissipate as it neared the Highway 83 and Highway 383 split due to a lack of any visible damage at that intersection.\nThe challenge with this survey was there were multiple vortices causing damage. Therefore, there were a few areas of more concentrated high-end EF-1 damage with broad/widespread EF-0 to EF-1 damage.\nThere was one minor injury with this event. The town tornado sirens were not functioning as a result of a power outage. Therefore, fire fighters jumped into their vehicles to drive through town to warn people of the coming tornado.

The most extensive tree damage was noted along Overshot Court where multiple hardwood and softwood trees were uprooted and snapped. About 100 trees were damaged on Overshot Court, with many uprooted trees falling in a convergent, crossing manner and pointed to the west-to-north (generally along and left of the tornado track). At least 20 hardwood trees ranging between 10 and 20 inches in diameter were snapped off about 10 feet above the ground. Some of the uprooted trees also fell towards the east. A house on Overshot Court had siding damage, lost a portion of its eave on the northeast side of the house, had a shutter blown off, and a flagpole blown down. Siding from this house was found 120 yards to the northwest of the house.\nEyewitness accounts were taken from several residents along Overshot Court. They all relayed a similar story of relatively quiet conditions followed by a loud and incessant roaring sound, with reduced visibility due to heavy rain and swirling winds. One resident texted that they entered their basement when they heard the loud roar, with the timestamp of that text being 4:57 PM EDT. All residents noted the damage occurred quickly lasting well less than one minute.\nAs the tornado moved northeastward, it crossed wooded areas south of the Carroll Manor Recreation Council Building on MD-145 Sweet Air Road, where limited tree damage was noted. No damage was noted along Fox Run Court, but as the tornado crossed the 14000 block of Blenheim Road, several trees were damaged; several were uprooted and several were topped. One large 2-foot-in-diameter tree was uprooted facing toward the west, while a trampoline from a residence was blown over 200 yards toward the east, and several softwood pine trees were snapped. The large uprooted tree damaged a section of a covered porch.\nThe tornado produced only minor tree damage as it moved northeastward from Blenheim Road, and may have lifted briefly as it crossed MD-145 Sweet Air Road just west of Manor Road. As the tornado crossed Manor Road just north of MD-145 Sweet Air Road, minor tree damage was noted mainly with mainly a few large tree branches down.\nFarther to the northeast, the tornado produced tree damage to a residence at the end of Cremson Drive off of Manor Road. A large hardwood tree about 20 inches in diameter was twisted off 10 feet up from the ground. A resident at this location described hearing a loud sound akin to a freight train and observed the tornado cause the aforementioned damage.

The tornado impacted several farmsteads along 250th producing EF1 damage to buildings and trees at many of the locations. The tornado was also quite wide with the the max width extending over 600 yards. The tornado continued into Bremer county. The tornado moved into Bremer county from Butler county. The tornado impacted a couple of acreages just east of the county line producing EF0 and EF1 damage before weakening and becoming an intermittent funnel. The tornado destroyed 2 barns just north of the 4th street SW exit off of Highway 218. It then crossed the Cedar River just southwest Waverly doing damage to houses on both sides of the river, mostly EF0 and EF1 damage.

This was a path length of 1.9 miles. The approximate path width was 75 yards.

Shingles were missing on a house next door. A playscape was lifted up and landed approximately 50 feet away. On Main Street, a small corner of a roof was exposed, with additional damage along the length of the gutter.

The tornado touched down near Southampton Road, Kelvin Avenue, and Trevose Road where it uprooted and blew down large limbs from a few softwood and hardwood trees. The tornado then moved into Bucks County, with trees uprooted at the county line. The tornado which began in Philadelphia County crossed into Bucks County, where it would produce the majority of its impacts. After crossing the county line, the tornado continued between Trevose Road and Peyton Street where additional tree damage occurred before crossing Lukens Street. The tornado then very briefly crossed back into Philadelphia County at the northern tip of Poquessing Valley Park where a few trees were uprooted. The tornado then crossed back into Trevose in Bucks County where it caused some minor cosmetic damage to some homes in the Beechwood Estates neighborhood and blew down several sections of vinyl fencing. Several small trees were also snapped or uprooted in and just south and east of the residential neighborhood.\nAs the tornado approached Somerton Road, it began intensifying and widening substantially as it moved into the Metropolitan Industrial Center. Numerous softwood and hardwood trees were snapped or uprooted in the SUEZ Water Company property southwest of and along Somerton Road. Five wooden power poles were snapped near the ground along Somerton Road as well at the northern end of the SUEZ property. All seven warehouse buildings in the industrial complex northeast of Somerton Road sustained at least minor damage, with the most significant occurring to the Northtec building. Numerous roof mounted HVAC units were shifted or blown off of a few of the buildings in the industrial complex. Open bay doors in the western- most building caused a non-load bearing interior wall to collapse. A sedan was lifted and flipped over in the Northtec parking lot and a steel flag pole bearing a flag flattened completely to the ground. The Northtec building sustained substantial structural damage where large sections of roofing material were removed. Additionally, numerous exterior paneling was blown off, garage bay doors were blown out, a few windows were blown out, and at least two large HVAC units were blown off of the building. Numerous softwood and hardwood trees were uprooted or snapped in the industrial complex and immediately adjacent areas.\nA cellphone tower adjacent to the industrial complex had all of the antennas blown off, but the tower itself did not collapse. Southeast of the industrial complex, minor cosmetic damage occurred to some homes along Carter Road in a residential neighborhood. Tree damage associated with the tornado occurred along Carter Road and Sussex Road north of Buckfield Terrace. This was the area where the tornado circulation reached its widest extent of around three tenths of a mile. As the tornado neared and crossed the Pennsylvania Turnpike (I- 276), an overhead roadway information sign was blown off and a portion of it landed downstream nearly a half mile away. Just north of the turnpike, minor cosmetic damage occurred to a hotel building where a tree was also uprooted in the parking lot. A large billboard was blown over just north of the turnpike and south of Street Road. A small utility building nearby had its roof blown off. The northern- most extent of the damage occurred on the Toscana 52 restaurant property where the tornado blew down some chain link fencing and uprooted a few small trees in the parking lot.\nThe tornado continued east-northeastward across Street Road toward the Faulkner car dealership complex where it began intensifying and somewhat narrowing its path of damage. The four dealership showrooms sustained significant damage where most windows were blown out and at least some roofing material was blown off. The most significant damage occurred to the Buick/GMC showroom where most of the roofing material was blown off, all windows and doors were blown out, and exterior walls exhibited fracturing due to stress from the wind. Roof HVAC units of this building were tossed into the parking lot behind the building. All of the dealership signs near the main road were destroyed. Scores of new and used vehicles sustained significant damage from flying debris or from being pushed or tossed trough the air.\nThe tornado continued toward the dealership's main service garage where the most significant damage occurred. The southwestern portion of the building was destroyed with most exterior walls collapsing completely and all roofing material blown off. Interior walls mostly remained standing. Roof HVAC units were tossed off of the building with one unit landing nearly 200 yards downstream of the building. Damage sustained to the building decreased somewhat toward the eastern end of it where portions of the exterior walls were damaged and almost all garage bay doors were blown out. The wind rushing through the garage area carried debris, car parts, and tools well away from the structure downstream. Some vehicles near the main garage building were completely destroyed from large pieces of flying debris or from being tossed and dropped back onto the ground. A small pickup truck was crushed from a collapsed exterior wall. Five people reportedly sustained minor injuries at the dealership complex.\nThe tornado continued east-northeast toward the Weisser Homes mobile home park and into an area of trees which sustained significant damage. Most tree canopies and limbs were completely stripped from the still standing or snapped trunks of hardwood trees in this area. A large storage container filled with car parts from the service garage parking lot upstream was lofted into the air and dropped into this area of trees. An uninhabited mobile home model was lifted and completely destroyed at the mobile home park. Another double-wide mobile home had a large portion of its roof blown off. Several other mobile home sustained varying degrees of damage as well. A large amount of various debris from the dealership complex landed in this mobile home park. Numerous softwood and hardwood trees near and just downstream of this area were snapped or uprooted along Old Lincoln Highway.\nAt this stage, the tornado damage path narrowed considerably and intensity weakened significantly as it crossed Old Lincoln Highway and moved toward the Lowe's and Walmart shopping centers on Route 1. The tornado passed over these shopping centers, but no structural damage was noted to these structures. Numerous small trees were snapped and uprooted in the large parking lot area and line of trees just north of the Bensalem turnpike interchange. Some exit ramp signs were blown down in the interchange area.\nThe tornado damage became somewhat discontinuous as it continued east-southeast into Bensalem across Route 1 and toward a residential neighborhood. Several homes in the neighborhood sustained loss of some roofing material and other cosmetic damage in addition to some tree damage. The tornado continued across Rockhill Road and along Richlieu Road toward the Christian Life Center where several trees were snapped or uprooted. The church's steeple had some paneling blown off, but the steeple itself was not damaged otherwise. The tornado continued weakening as it crossed Galloway Road then dissipated in the Bensalem Township Community Park where some minor tree damage occurred.\nNo known serious injuries or fatalities occurred from this tornado.", "F_scale": 3.0, "Wind": 140.0, "Source": "NWS Storm Survey", "State1": "PA", "State2": null, "State3": null, "SPC_id": 620349.0, "NCEI_id": "971957, 971958" }, "geometry": { "type": "LineString", "coordinates": [ [ -75.00517431, 40.129580275 ], [ -75.00029269, 40.131106043 ], [ -74.993726642, 40.131786885 ], [ -74.982935385, 40.133419239 ], [ -74.977442221, 40.134206692 ], [ -74.974028499, 40.134961326 ], [ -74.969736964, 40.135240211 ], [ -74.940747649, 40.13012168 ] ] } },

Only four other EF2 or stronger tornadoes have occurred in the state in the past 10 years.\nOn Wednesday afternoon, a tornado that peaked in intensity with winds estimated at 125 mph traveled northeast along a path through Anne Arundel County and the City of Annapolis. It not only snapped numerous trees, but also produced significant structural damage to homes, businesses, and a school. Fortunately, there were no injuries reported, even though it tracked through a heavily populated area. Several eyewitnesses to the event reported getting the NWS Tornado Warning through their cell phone in advance, and sheltering in response to the warning.\nFrom the NWS storm survey, the first damage noted, and recorded touchdown point was in Owensville, Maryland, in southern Anne Arundel County, near the intersection of Sudley Road and Owensville Road. This included a large limb from a tree top over Sudley Road and several portions of large cedar trees snapped along Owensville Road. The tornado moved northeast across rural southern Anne Arundel County before crossing Mill Swamp Road. Here, about a quarter of a mile east of the intersection with Dove Farm Road, dozens of trees and large branches were snapped and uprooted in a path from southwest to northeast as far as you could see in either direction from the road. While the dominant direction of the tree damage was being blown down to the north or northeast, there were trees downed in multiple directions, and many were topped.\nThe tornado intensified further as it moved into the South River Colony community. Dozens of trees were downed along the easternmost portions of Monarch Drive. Homes near the intersection of Monarch Drive and Red Admiral Court were particularly hard hit by some of the strongest winds of the entire tornado path. Several had significant portions of their roof damaged or removed, and one home in the middle of the track was unroofed entirely. One resident in this area reported seeing the tornado as it approached. The tornado then crossed South River Golf Links before moving into a campus of school buildings that includes South River High School and the Center of Applied Technology South. There it damaged the upper parts of the football field grandstands and concessions stand, damaged the roof, and caused cosmetic damage to some of the upper portions of the Center of Applied Technology South. The schools were left structurally sound, and the staff and some students that were there were able to shelter without injury.\nThe tornado crossed Central Avenue around 2:11 PM and moved into Edgewater. Here it crossed the communities of Woodland Beach, Londontowne, and Edgewater Park. Dozens of trees and large branches were snapped, and portions of 5 to 10 roofs were noted to have been damaged. One home near the intersection of Millstone Drive and Oakwood Road had only damaged roof trusses remaining of its roof.\nThe tornado crossed the South River and moved through western portions of the City of Annapolis at peak intensity with winds estimated at 125 mph at 2:20 PM. Several trees were snapped along the path as it crossed Aris T. Allen Boulevard just east of the Annapolis Harbour Center shopping area. It crossed Forest Drive at the intersection of Parole Street. Several homes there sustained roof damage, and one home was unroofed entirely. As it crossed the area near the intersection of West Street and Lee Street, the most substantial structural damage was noted. A large warehouse building had the winds enter the south side of the building and blow out a large portion of the west side cinder block wall. The roof with large metal trusses was largely removed. A fast food restaurant had its sign entirely removed from its post. Another commercial building had its roof removed, significant upper portions of the cinder block building removed, and its large commercial sign post blown over. A strip mall across the street had its windows blown out and flat roof damaged. All the telephone poles and attached wires along this stretch of West Street were downed. Another commercial building had its windows blown out. Several eyewitnesses saw the tornado as it passed.\nAdditional residential roof damage occurred as the tornado moved north over Bowman Court. From here, the tornado crossed into the community of Admiral Heights. Affected were areas along Halsey Road and adjacent Cedar Park Road. Here, the wind did not directly cause any structural damage, but about a dozen trees were snapped. That included one large, healthy tree about two and a half feet in diameter. The tornado crossed Weems Creek and Rowe Boulevard, and then snapped several trees along Riverview Avenue.\nFinally, the tornado crossed US Route 50/301 a few hundred yards west of the Severn River Bridge, snapping trees on both sides of the highway. The final damage noted occurred at the end of Acorn Drive at the last residential property that sits on the shore of the Severn River. Several trees were snapped here. The tornado dissipated here, or as it crossed the Severn River. The survey team was not able to find any damage north of the Severn River, and video evidence from social media indicates the funnel dissipated here.", "F_scale": 2.0, "Wind": 125.0, "Source": "NWS Storm Survey", "State1": "MD", "State2": null, "State3": null, "SPC_id": 620510.0, "NCEI_id": "971241" }, "geometry": { "type": "LineString", "coordinates": [ [ -76.595513947, 38.849851128 ], [ -76.595589049, 38.852257482 ], [ -76.574850209, 38.883933549 ], [ -76.562404759, 38.917598945 ], [ -76.554079182, 38.933691242 ], [ -76.545753605, 38.948645123 ], [ -76.53262151, 38.972271166 ], [ -76.529617436, 38.977609293 ], [ -76.521034367, 38.986282892 ], [ -76.509790547, 38.997957212 ], [ -76.508726369, 39.001377328 ] ] } },

One car port had significant damage from large, 4-inch oak limbs falling on it. Minor roof damage occurred, including shingles and large limbs falling on a few homes. One tree fell on a homeowner's pick-up truck, resulting in significant damage.\nMore substantial wind damage occurred at 10850 East Blue River Road. A large jacuzzi was picked up and thrown 10 yards. The hot tub was not full of water but weighed a substantial amount. Cedar trees were snapped and twisted and numerous maple and sycamore trees were uprooted, snapped and twisted all across the property.\nDrone footage showed trees going in multiple directions, especially from the north through southeasterly directions.

The tornado crossed U.S. Highway 67 where it topped, snapped, and uprooted trees. The tornado traveled northeast paralleling a portion of Possum Hollow Road where tree damage was extensive with numerous snapped and uprooted trees. Several homes along this stretch were damaged, primarily due to fallen trees. The tornado then struck a farmstead near a bend in Possum Hollow Road where it completely destroyed two outbuildings. Neither of these structures were well-anchored and damage was rated at EF-1. The tornado continued to the northeast snapping and uprooting trees. A homeowner with 40 acres of land along Knob Lick Road estimated that 60-70% of the trees were destroyed. Extensive damage was found near the intersection of Knob Lick Road and Old Fredericktown Road.

Damage from the homes, a destroyed garage, and trees was strewn hundreds of yards to the north. The path width of the tornado at this point was just over 400 yards. The tornado then crossed Highway OO where the width was around 450 yards. A home lost part of its roof, a barn was damaged, and numerous trees were snapped or uprooted along this stretch. All of this damage was rated at EF-1. The tornado crossed Smith Road destroying several barns and damaging a manufactured home, and then crossed Busiek Road damaging a small barn, several farm outbuildings and totally destroying a large well built farm outbuilding. Damage in this area was rated EF-1 or EF-2. The 400+ yard wide tornado crossed the St. Francois County/Ste. Genevieve County line just north of Green Acres Lane. The 400+ yard wide tornado crossed the St. Francois County/Ste. Genevieve County line just north of Green Acres Lane. The tornado then traveled to the northeast crossing Route F multiple times as it traveled towards Coffman. Numerous trees were snapped or uprooted along this path, a number of farm outbuildings and barns were damaged or destroyed, and several homes suffered partial roof damage. The worst damage occurred to a home on Route AA just north of Route F. This home was completely destroyed. All of the walls were completely blown into the rear of the foundation and the roof was totally removed. Little anchoring was evident to the walls. One minor injury occurred to a male at the residence who found shelter in the pantry area. Tree damage in this area was some of the worst noted with every tree snapped or sheared supporting an EF-3 damage rating to the home. Another home on McDaniel Road just north of Route F sustained severe damage. The roof was completely removed and a large portion of the northeast walls were removed. Little if any anchoring of the walls was evident which supported an EF-2 damage rating. Numerous power poles and trees were snapped along Route F as the tornado traveled to the northeast into Coffman. Crown Valley Brewing and Distilling suffered minor damage, however the building on the north side of Route F was heavily damaged, rated at EF-1. A small building adjacent to the main Coffman Baptist Church was completely destroyed with debris blown into the main church building. There was no anchoring evident in this small building and damage was rated at EF-1. The tornado continued to the east-northeast crossing Madden Creek. The last detectable damage and thus end point was around 4 miles east-northeast of Coffman, southeast of Brands Lake near Goat Hill Trail.

The tornado continued to the northeast along the river and began impacting homes as it approached Fredericktown. Here the tornado ripped half of the roof off of one home, rolled a manufactured home onto its side, pulled roofing material from another home, and continued to cause considerable tree damage. The tornado widened to about 1/2 mile as it approached MO Highway 72 from the southwest, damaging multiple homes and businesses. A business on the south side of Highway 72 is where the only known injury took place, where an individual was hurt climbing out of the debris after the tornado had exited the area. The tornado strengthened as it moved north of Highway 72, completely destroying a number of homes. It was determined that the frames of these homes were largely only toe-nailed into their foundation, which precluded a higher rating than a low-end EF-3. The tornado then impacted the Black River Electric Co-op. Here the tornado ripped a well-built canopy from between two small warehouses, completely destroyed one of these small warehouses, and then completely destroyed a larger steel warehouse attached to the main office. The steel warehouse was very well constructed, with steel I-beams approximately 1 foot in width, bolted into the concrete foundation roughly every 20 feet. These beams spanned the roof of the structure and supported a thick, crimped sheet metal exterior. This is believed to be where the tornado reached peak intensity, with approximately 150 mph winds. The attached office fared notably better, sustaining mainly roof damage and the loss of several windows. The office was very well constructed, consisting of brick and concrete walls. The tornado then crossed US highway 67 and continued to cause considerable damage. Two newly built self-storage buildings with north facing bay doors were completely destroyed, while a third identical building with south facing doors was damaged, but remained standing. Two more homes were also impacted in this area. The roof was completely ripped from one of these homes, though most of the walls, which were bolted into the concrete foundation, were left standing. Only a few interior walls remained on the second home, though it appeared that the frame of this home was only toe-nailed into the foundation. The poor construction of the second home, and the lack of hurricane clips on the roof of the first, precluded a higher rating than EF-2 in this area. As the tornado continued northeast, it moved through additional residential areas, damaging several more homes and businesses. The tornado may have begun to weaken somewhat at this point, as the walls largely remained standing on most of these buildings. The tornado then began to move into more rural areas to the northeast of Fredericktown, where it caused consistent tree damage for several more miles, ripped most of the roof from one home, and completely destroyed a barn. The tornado may have briefly lifted as it moved into northeastern Madison County before coming back down and causing considerable tree damage along Madison county road 252. Along the Madison/Perry county line, where it moved into WFO Paducah's County Warning Area, the width was about 1/2 of a mile wide with numerous trees snapped and uprooted. The portion of the tornado path in Madison County was rated EF3 overall with a path length of 14.83 miles and a max path width of 880 yards. There was one injury and no deaths in Madison County. Overall, the tornado (Madison/Perry Counties) was rated EF3 with a path length of 18.95 miles and a max path width of 880 yards. There was one injury and no deaths with this tornado. This long-track tornado crossed into southwest Perry County from Madison County. Along the Madison/Perry county line, the width was about half of a mile wide, with numerous trees snapped and uprooted. The tornado then moved nearly parallel to County Road 738. Here several houses and a hunting lodge sustained minor damage, mainly to roofs and posts of a porch. One barn and a small shed were destroyed, along with numerous uprooted and snapped trees. The tornado continued on to produce tree damage on Highway 730, where it was only a few hundred yards wide and dissipated shortly thereafter. Peak winds in the Perry County portion of the path were near 112 mph, putting it barely into the EF-2 category. However, the tornado peaked at EF-3 intensity earlier in its life cycle.", "F_scale": 3.0, "Wind": 150.0, "Source": "NWS Storm Survey", "State1": "MO", "State2": null, "State3": null, "SPC_id": 620662.0, "NCEI_id": "988886, 984610" }, "geometry": { "type": "LineString", "coordinates": [ [ -90.392144423, 37.542519593 ], [ -90.35437892, 37.560007746 ], [ -90.327256422, 37.572525926 ], [ -90.307558279, 37.579056315 ], [ -90.288804274, 37.583341571 ], [ -90.2771313, 37.587218496 ], [ -90.266144972, 37.590211072 ], [ -90.252412062, 37.598916061 ], [ -90.234215956, 37.606804079 ], [ -90.192201834, 37.62033416 ], [ -90.149758558, 37.633453949 ], [ -90.117185812, 37.640794581 ], [ -90.07693122, 37.650852788 ] ] } },

The tornado moved out of Missouri (Ste. Genevieve County) into Illinois (Randolph County) moving though flood plains and crossing the Mississippi River just north of the Menard Correctional Center. The tornado crossed Route 3 south of Lochhead Drive destroying a small barn, snapping or uprooting trees, and caused minor damage to several homes and a hardware store. Snapped or uprooted trees and downed power poles were found along the remainder of the tornado track through Chester with roof damage to several homes on Brenda Street. The worst damage in Chester occurred just northeast of the Palestine Road and Three Spring Roads intersection, where two farm outbuildings were completely destroyed. The larger of the two buildings was well-built with anchor bolts every 18-24 inches in the concrete foundation. This damage was rated EF-2. Further northeast, minor roof damage and the loss of the roof-mounted HVAC unit was found at the nursing home near Old Lodge Lane and Three Springs Road. The tornado continued to the northeast into Bremen paralleling and crossing Route 150, producing tree damage and minor roof damage to several homes. Minor roof damage to several homes, damage to several farm outbuildings, and snapped and uprooted trees were found along parts of Chester Road and Paradise Road.

There was one person injured and 6 fatalities at the Amazon facility. The tornado weakened as it moved northeast across Sand Road, where it destroyed an unanchored mobile home and an outbuilding, snapped trees, and downed power poles. Damage in this area was rated EF-1. Further northeast, the tornado crossed South University Drive where it snapped a power pole and downed additional trees. It then crossed into the Sunset Hills Country Club subdivision. Throughout a portion of the subdivision, there were downed trees, snapped branches, and superficial home damage consisting of missing shingles or small portions of roof covering. The tornado weakened further as it moved northeast, and lifted just west of Butler Boulevard at 8:35 PM CST.

A home suffered roof damage on Woodland Mills Road and trees were uprooted north of Woodland Mills. The tornado then crossed into Fulton County and eventually intensified into an EF-4 as it approached Mayfield, Kentucky. Peak winds in Obion County were estimated at 75 mph. This historic EF-4 tornado was associated with a very long-track supercell that originally formed over eastern Arkansas. The supercell produced a nearly continuous tornado damage path from northeast Arkansas across western Tennessee and western Kentucky. The starting point of this particular tornado was in northwest Tennessee, northwest of Union City (see Storm Data, Tennessee, Western for information on this and other tornadoes associated with the supercell). This tornado crossed from Obion County, Tennessee into Fulton County, Kentucky about 6 miles southeast of Hickman, close to the communities of State Line, KY and Woodland Mills, TN. The tornado rapidly widened, becoming over a mile wide across northeast Fulton County. The primary impact to Fulton County was on the community of Cayce, where the tornado achieved a rating of EF-4. This community was the site of the only fatality in Fulton County. A 57-year-old male occupant of a mobile home was killed. On the southwest edge of Cayce, a house was demolished (DI 2, DOD 9). This demolished house was assigned an estimated wind speed of 170 mph, the highest in the county. A small retail building in the center of town was demolished (DI 8, DOD 8). A total of 61 structures were affected in Fulton County, with 21 of those totally destroyed or uninhabitable. A number of vehicles were thrown and destroyed, including some farm equipment. Nearly total tree destruction was observed in the Cayce area. The average path width was a mile. The tornado exited Fulton County into Hickman County in a rural area about 7 miles northwest of Fulton. This historic EF-4 tornado was associated with a very long-track supercell that originally formed over eastern Arkansas. The supercell produced a nearly continuous tornado damage path from northeast Arkansas across western Tennessee and western Kentucky. The starting point of this particular tornado was in northwest Tennessee, northwest of Union City (see Storm Data, Tennessee, Western for information on this and other tornadoes associated with the supercell). This tornado crossed from Fulton County into Hickman County about 7 miles northwest of Fulton, close to the community of Croley. The tornado was exceptionally wide as it entered Hickman County, becoming about 1.5 miles wide. The tornado track in Hickman County was over rural farmland, bypassing small communities. The tornado achieved a rating of EF-3 over far eastern Hickman County, along Highway 58 near the Graves County line. This is where numerous wooden towers carrying electrical transmission lines collapsed (DI 24, DOD 6). This damage site is where the tornado was assigned the highest estimated wind speed in the county, about 140 mph. On Highway 307, there were four collapsed metal truss towers for carrying electrical transmission lines (DI 24, DOD 6). There were several injuries but no fatalities in the county. About a dozen homes were destroyed countywide. A mobile home was destroyed (DI 3, DOD 9). Most walls of one destroyed house collapsed, except small interior rooms (DI 2, DOD 8). The damage rating of this house was lowered due to toe nail construction. A total of 41 homes were damaged in Hickman County, and 12 were destroyed or uninhabitable. Hundreds of trees were snapped or uprooted. The average path width was about 1.25 miles (2250 yards). The tornado exited Hickman County into Graves County in a rural area about one-half mile north of where Highway 58 crosses the county line. This tornado crossed from Hickman County into Graves County about one-half mile north of where Highway 58 crosses the county line, close to the tiny community of Baltimore. The tornado was about 1.3 miles wide when it entered the county. It varied from 1 to 1.3 miles in width as it traversed Graves County. The primary impact to Graves County was on the city of Mayfield, where the tornado achieved a rating of EF-4. This city suffered a devastating impact, in terms of both loss of life and property destruction. There were 23 fatalities countywide and many more injuries. On the southwest edge of Mayfield as the tornado entered the city, a candle factory was demolished (DI 23, DOD 7). At least nine workers in the factory were killed. The tornado continued northeast through the heart of Mayfield at 9:28 PM CST, averaging just over one mile in width. The downtown area was directly impacted, crippling the police and fire department headquarters and emergency communications. Residential neighborhoods both southwest and northeast of downtown were destroyed. Numerous businesses in the downtown business district collapsed. Several damage sites in the city of Mayfield received a wind speed estimate of 188 mph, the highest in the county. Many of the structures were historic brick buildings (DI 17, DOD 7). At least 1,500 structures were damaged or destroyed, including a couple hundred businesses. The Red Cross estimated that 730 dwellings were uninhabitable. A large number of vehicles were thrown and destroyed, including some farm equipment in rural areas outside the city. Nearly total tree destruction was observed. The first EF-4 damage in the county was noted at and around the candle factory on the southwest side of Mayfield. Near the candle factory, a house was swept clean off the concrete slab (DI 2, DOD 10). The last EF-4 damage points in the county were on the northeast side of Mayfield, including a nursing home (DI 7, DOD 7). After entering Graves County, the tornado intersected I-69 (formerly the Purchase Parkway) four miles southwest of the Mayfield city limit. A wind gust to 93 knots or 107 mph was measured at the University of Kentucky mesonet site 6 miles southwest of Mayfield. The tornado then closely followed Interstate 69 northeast all the way to Marshall County. The tornado crossed the interstate multiple times. The first crossing was two miles southwest of Mayfield, then again northeast of Mayfield just east of the Highway 131 interchange, and again at the Marshall County line. The interstate was blocked in spots by trees, power lines, and debris. From Highway 131 to Highway 301 northeast of Mayfield, the tornado followed the exact same path as the May 10, 2016 EF-3 tornado. Some of the same structures that were damaged in that tornado were destroyed by this tornado. The tornado exited Graves County into Marshall County along Interstate 69 (formerly the Purchase Parkway) where it crosses the county line. This tornado crossed from Graves County into Marshall County along Interstate 69 about seven miles west-southwest of Benton. The tornado widened to nearly 1.5 miles (2450 yards) soon after crossing into Marshall County. The tornado width fluctuated from 0.8 mile to nearly 1.5 miles during its trek across the county. The community most impacted was Cambridge Shores, a rather dense subdivision of vacation homes and some luxury homes on Kentucky Lake. This is the only location in Marshall County where the tornado achieved a rating of EF-4. This community was the site of the only fatalities in Marshall County. A 78-year-old female resident died in the hallway of her house. Another elderly woman died of a heart attack while trying to remove debris (indirect). There were numerous homes in Cambridge Shores that were levelled, including the loss of all walls (DI 2, DOD 9). Some homes were wiped off the foundation. Marshall County's highest wind speed estimate of 170 mph was assigned to the damage in the Cambridge Shores area. A total of 356 structures in Marshall County were destroyed or uninhabitable. Another 341 structures sustained light to moderate damage. A number of vehicles were thrown and destroyed, including some that landed in Kentucky Lake. Nearly total tree destruction was observed in the Cambridge Shores area. After crossing into Marshall County, the tornado path stayed over Interstate 69 from the county line to about three miles west of Benton. In this area a few miles west of Benton, a home was blown off its foundation and a few other homes were demolished (DI 2, DOD 9). The tornado narrowly missed the county seat of Benton, passing only a mile or two northwest of the downtown area. Where the tornado crossed U.S. 641 just north of Benton, a home was destroyed with the exception of some interior walls (DI 2, DOD 8). The tornado crossed U.S. Highway 68 about one mile southeast of the county high school, then continued on to Cambridge Shores. The tornado exited Marshall County into Lyon County over Kentucky Lake, about 1.5 miles east-northeast of Cambridge Shores. his tornado crossed from Marshall County into Lyon County, Kentucky near the Hillman Ferry Campground in the Land Between the Lakes National Recreation Area. The tornado crossed the Trace Highway causing near complete tree destruction and broke one wooden electrical transmission line (DI 24, DOD 4). The tornado achieved its highest rating of EF-3 as it emerged from Lake Barkley just north of Eddy Creek. Numerous homes were completely destroyed (DI 2, DOD 9) between the shore and Interstate 24 near Mile Marker 46. The damage rating of a house in this area corresponded with a wind speed of 150 mph, the highest in the county. The tornado continued to the county line producing mainly tree damage with occasional structural damage. A 98-year-old female occupant died of injuries incurred in her home south of Eddyville. In addition, 5 others were injured throughout Lyon county. A total of 141 structures were affected in Lyon County, with 45 of those totally destroyed or uninhabitable. Nearly total tree destruction was observed in the Land Between the Lakes area. The average path width was a mile. The tornado exited Lyon County into Caldwell County in a rural area about 7 miles east southeast of Eddyville. The tornado crossed from Lyon County into Caldwell County in a rural area about 7 miles east southeast of Eddyville. The tornado crossed the Princeton Golf and Country Club resulting in collapsed walls of nearby homes (DI 2, DOD 10). This is where it achieved its highest rating of EF-4. A house near this country club received the highest wind speed estimate in the county, which was 180 mph. The tornado crossed southeast of Princeton, destroying large sections of the University Of Kentucky Research and Education Center (DI 15, DOD 10). The tornado then damaged many homes and trees near and just south of U.S. Highway 62 (Dawson Road). Just southwest of the intersection of US 62 and CR 2619, the tornado took a more easterly path (or rightward jog), continuing to damage homes along U.S. Highway 62 (Dawson Road) (DI 2, DOD 9). Two of the fatalities occurred at permanent homes on Dawson Road. The tornado trajectory then shifted back to northeast (or leftward jog), after which it crossed into Hopkins County on the southwest side of Dawson Springs. There were four fatalities in Caldwell County, with 11 others injured, 3 critically. All four of the deceased were found outside their residences. A couple who resided in a mobile home were both killed between Princeton and Dawson Springs. In total, around 300 structures were completely destroyed. The average path width was a mile. This tornado crossed from Caldwell County into Hopkins County near the city limit of Dawson Springs, which straddles the county line. The tornado produced catastrophic damage and some fatalities in Dawson Springs. About two-thirds of the city's homes were destroyed, and about a dozen fatalities occurred. There were at least 200 injuries. The core of the tornado narrowly missed the downtown Dawson Springs business district, but a large residential neighborhood on the north side of downtown was destroyed. This neighborhood is where the tornado obtained its maximum EF-4 rating in Hopkins County. A two-story apartment building was almost totally destroyed. Only a few first-story interior walls remained standing (DI 5, DOD 6). This apartment building is where the damage was assigned a wind speed estimate of 180 mph, the highest in the county. On the northern edge of town, over a dozen duplexes suffered complete roof loss. All exterior and interior walls of one of the units collapsed (DI 2, DOD 9). Most of the single-family homes suffered complete roof loss and the loss of most exterior walls (DI 2, DOD 8). In a few cases, there was complete destruction of residences (DI 2, DOD 10). On Highway 109 on the northeast side of town, a large retail structure with a long-span roof was destroyed (DI 12, DOD 7). Nearby, about a half dozen other smaller homes and businesses were demolished, including the loss of all walls (DI 9, DOD 9). Once the tornado exited the Dawson Springs area, it crossed Interstate 69 (formerly the Western Kentucky Parkway) about three miles northeast of Dawson Springs. A clearly defined wide path of nearly total tree destruction crossed the interstate. A house near the interstate suffered the loss of the roof and most walls, except for a few walls of small interior rooms (DI 2, DOD 8). Where the tornado crossed Highway 112, a few single-family homes were demolished, including the loss of the roof and all or most walls (DI 2, DOD 8-9). The tornado continued across heavily forested land until reaching Barnsley, a small community between Earlington and Mortons Gap on U.S. Highway 41. Several houses were demolished, including the loss of all walls (DI 2, DOD 9). In addition, a train was derailed and a 55-foot tanker car was thrown 20 yards from the railroad tracks (DI 29, DOD 1). The tornado then continued through a long swath of forest before crossing Interstate 69 midway between Madisonville and the Western Kentucky Parkway. Hundreds of trees were snapped at this interstate crossing (DI 27, DOD 4). A number of vehicles were thrown and destroyed across the county. The total number of affected structures countywide was estimated near 1000. A little over 500 structures were completely destroyed. Nearly total tree destruction was observed all along the path. The average path width was a mile. The tornado exited Hopkins County across the Pond River into Muhlenberg County about 6.5 miles east-southeast of Madisonville. This tornado crossed from Hopkins County into Muhlenberg County at the Pond River, about 8 miles southwest of Bremen. The primary impact to Muhlenberg County was in and around the community of Bremen, where the tornado achieved a rating of EF-4. The Bremen area was the site of most of the 11 fatalities in Muhlenberg County. A total of 165 structures were damaged or destroyed, of which 84 were completely destroyed or uninhabitable. The remainder were damaged at least moderately. The majority of these structures were along and just south of Highway 175 from 5 miles southwest of Bremen to the community of Bremen. Several demolished houses in this area warranted a rating of EF-4. The destruction of one house warranted a wind speed estimate of 190 mph, the highest in the county and the entire track. One brick home on Highway 175 collapsed, and another was swept off the foundation (DI 2, DOD 9). A car in the garage was thrown across the road. A couple of poorly anchored houses were swept clean off the foundation within a few miles west of Bremen (DI 2, DOD 9-10). On the north side of Bremen, a two-story home was completely destroyed. The foundation was not swept clean, but all walls were gone. Much of the remainder of the path through Muhlenberg County was unpopulated woods and fields. There was a cluster of damaged or destroyed structures near the community of Moorman, near where the tornado crossed U.S. Highway 431. In this area, a couple houses were heavily damaged, but most walls remained standing (DI 2, DOD 6). A number of vehicles were thrown and destroyed countywide, including some farm equipment. Nearly total tree destruction was observed in the path. The average path width was a mile. The tornado exited Muhlenberg County into Ohio County on the Green River about 2.5 miles east of Moorman. See Storm Data, Kentucky, Central for information on the remainder of this tornado path. The tornado finally came to an end in Grayson County, Kentucky at Rough River Dam State Park. This is the first of five segments of this tornado in the Louisville, Kentucky County Warning Area. The tornado was at EF-1 strength when it crossed the Green River from Muhlenberg County into Ohio County. The tornado retained EF-1 strength through an abandoned coal strip mine, snapping hardwood trees, overturning a large section of coal conveyor belt, and downing steel and wood power poles. Rugged terrain seems to have affected the tornado at times as it fluctuated in width and intensity moving across A9 Road, to Matanzas Road, and approaching A5 road. It weakened to around the EF-0/EF-1 threshold and narrowed to 200-300 yards as it crossed A5 Road and A6 Lane, before rapidly intensifying to EF-2 strength over Chandle Loop and Highway 85. Here, a large chicken farm lost 5 out of 7 of its well built chicken houses. The foundations were swept clean. In addition, several homes and barns suffered major damage or total destruction. Hundreds of large hardwoods were snapped and uprooted. One well built house had a large portion of roof removed along with partial wall collapse. Max width in this area was around a quarter mile. The tornado maintained solid EF-1 strength and narrowed to a width around 300 yards as it briefly paralleled Carter Ferry Road, and then approached and crossed A7 Road. From here, a significant topography change occurred as the tornado crossed the Rough River and entered much flatter open farmland. Damage was noted to a grove of snapped hardwood trees near Johnson School and Mud College Roads. Then, several (6 or 7) large steel electrical transmission lines were either broken or bent across a widening half to almost three quarter mile wide width. The tornado had gained significant intensity up to EF-2/EF-3 strength as it slammed into homes and businesses along US 231 only about 1 to 1.5 miles NW of Hartford. On the west side of US 231, two semi tractor trailers were lifted, twisted, and thrown 40 yards from their original position, badly mangling one of the cabs. In addition, a barn was completely demolished. A small, brick office structure was totally destroyed only leaving one half of a wall and a few interior rooms, while completely wiping away the other half of the building. Winds peaked at an estimated 140 mph here. Across the highway a well built, and nearly 100 year old, brick two story home lost its entire roof and collapsed a couple of upstairs walls. Other homes, very large silos, small businesses, and a fertilizer storage facility were heavily damaged in addition to some very large and healthy hardwood trees being snapped, twisted, and snarled. The tornado maintained EF-2/EF-3 intensity as it continued northeastward, crossing the William H Natcher Parkway and approaching Highway 69. Here, more intense damage occurred along 69 between Utley Road and along Morrison Run. At Utley Road, 2 homes and 1 double wide trailer were completely destroyed, and a 4th brick home lost an entire roof and collapsed a couple of walls. Here, an amazing survival story occurred as the residents of the 3 structures that were completely destroyed hunkered in the bathroom of the brick home and rode out the intense tornado. Luckily, no injuries occurred thanks to the great decisions made by the occupants to find a sturdier structure to ride out the storm. A large barn was also heavily damaged here. The next set of homes downstream from Utley Road experienced very intense damage. Here, two anchored mobile homes were completely destroyed as their frames were tossed and bent. One frame ended up 100 yards from its original position. A fifth wheel camper was thrown and landed upside down 30 yards from where it sat. A small farmhouse was also heavily damaged as some walls completely collapsed. Another survival story occurred here as residents made a decision to leave the area to seek better shelter. Many compliments were given to local television media coverage and warning lead time. Two more homes were either heavily damaged or destroyed as the tornado crossed Highway 69. A well built two story home lost half of its upper story, and a small brick home was sheared in half. Damage was observed by NWS surveyors to several hardwood trees along Morrison Run from Cedar Grove Road. However, the most intense tree damage of the Ohio County path occurred along Humble Valley Road where some local terrain influences very likely funneled the tornadic winds into a consolidated area. Here, strong EF-2 to near EF-3 winds snapped thousands of hardwood trees and damaged a few homes, barns, and sheds. It took 2 to 3 days to clear Humble Valley Road for access. A barn was destroyed, along with tree damage, and complete destruction of a home under construction along W Halls Creek Road. As the tornado continued toward the intersection of highways 878 and 919, it crossed Bean Hill doing mainly tree damage. It then did major tree damage, unroofed a home, and destroyed a barn at that intersection. Heavy damage occurred at New Baymus Road where a farm lost three substantial barns, and a deer farm was heavily damaged along with a bunch of equipment. Clinton Lane was the next to be hit as a brand new barn, power poles, and a few structures were damaged or destroyed. The barn was totally destroyed and thrown hundreds of yards downstream, and hundreds of hardwood trees were snapped. One cow was killed by flying debris here. Downwind of that, a trailer was cut in half amongst very heavy tree damage, and the occupants of the mangled half of the trailer had fled to a safer shelter. Hundreds of hardwoods were snapped around Cane Ford Lane along with total destruction of an old trailer. From there, the tornado climbed a ridge and crossed Highway 54, heavily damaging a home and garage, along with continuing to mangle hundreds of hardwood and softwood trees. The tornado finally came to an end in Grayson County, Kentucky at Rough River Dam State Park. This is the third of five segments of this tornado in the Louisville, Kentucky County Warning Area. As the tornado entered Grayson County, the path crossed the Rough River about 1 mile WNW of the Lafayette Golf Club. The tornado snapped several hardwood trees in this area before moving almost a half mile across an open flood plain. The tornado then continued northeast through a heavily wooded area, continuing to snap and uproot hardwood trees along the path. There some strong EF-1 intensity damage happened in a development area a mile north of the Falls of Rough State Resort where intense snarling of a cluster of hardwood trees was indicative of winds just over 100 mph. A well built structure was mostly spared as an inflow vortex fed into the main tornado path around the southeast side of the house. Extensive tree damage occurred in this area where over 100 hardwood trees were snapped and uprooted.This is the fourth of five segments of this tornado in the Louisville, Kentucky County Warning Area. The tornado finally came to an end in Grayson County, Kentucky at Rough River Dam State Park. The tornado continued onward crossing Highway 110, going over a ridgetop and snapping more trees. More extensive tree damage occurred as the tornado briefly paralleled another portion of the Rough River as it crossed Old Railroad Bed Road. The tornado finally came to an end in Grayson County, Kentucky at Rough River Dam State Park. This is the fifth of five segments of this tornado in the Louisville, Kentucky County Warning Area. The tornado travelled another 1 mile to 1.5 miles to a large boat storage facility on the Falls of Rough Road. The boat facility was heavily damaged due to winds easily tearing apart open boat storage structures. Large debris from these structures was scattered 300 yards across Falls of Rough Road and a runway. Power lines were also taken down along Falls of Rough Road. Damage ended just shy of the Rough River Dam Resort State Park on the western Banks of Rough River Lake.", "F_scale": 4.0, "Wind": 190.0, "Source": "NWS Storm Survey", "State1": "TN", "State2": "KY", "State3": null, "SPC_id": 620750.0, "NCEI_id": "997426, 994038, 994194, 994196, 994199, 994954, 995882, 995999, 996014, 996991, 996995, 996997, 996998, 996999" }, "geometry": { "type": "LineString", "coordinates": [ [ -89.13499195, 36.483238637 ], [ -89.09387904, 36.511224248 ], [ -89.07276469, 36.526123699 ], [ -89.051650341, 36.542951111 ], [ -89.034655865, 36.554397174 ], [ -89.024012859, 36.560877929 ], [ -89.002383526, 36.573424227 ], [ -88.973544414, 36.584590096 ], [ -88.916209515, 36.614357853 ], [ -88.846858318, 36.651826836 ], [ -88.787806805, 36.677438517 ], [ -88.718798931, 36.701940638 ], [ -88.6648535, 36.729447028 ], [ -88.631938274, 36.744319121 ], [ -88.604815777, 36.759723681 ], [ -88.575976665, 36.775125147 ], [ -88.526881512, 36.800145931 ], [ -88.422511394, 36.841920664 ], [ -88.401912029, 36.856206784 ], [ -88.368266399, 36.874609965 ], [ -88.33599406, 36.887517014 ], [ -88.307154949, 36.904814529 ], [ -88.272479351, 36.917716471 ], [ -88.225444134, 36.936379247 ], [ -88.171542461, 36.959426957 ], [ -88.105624493, 36.990969059 ], [ -88.073352154, 37.008243102 ], [ -88.042453106, 37.026335509 ], [ -88.012240703, 37.04003901 ], [ -87.996447857, 37.043053448 ], [ -87.94323283, 37.063877206 ], [ -87.90581065, 37.078395655 ], [ -87.856414245, 37.099948049 ], [ -87.803843792, 37.124398028 ], [ -87.764018352, 37.143557437 ], [ -87.745822246, 37.156692514 ], [ -87.705996807, 37.165174371 ], [ -87.676127727, 37.178305693 ], [ -87.632525738, 37.195537088 ], [ -87.595790203, 37.213858226 ], [ -87.561114605, 37.228347916 ], [ -87.484896953, 37.258685227 ], [ -87.435115154, 37.28873718 ], [ -87.368167217, 37.313589272 ], [ -87.318042095, 37.331881717 ], [ -87.272380169, 37.349623863 ], [ -87.2064622, 37.374182991 ], [ -87.159770306, 37.392460678 ], [ -87.128527935, 37.401188748 ], [ -87.098365318, 37.40676912 ], [ -87.075912026, 37.412981661 ], [ -87.06844474, 37.414970605 ], [ -87.061286461, 37.416770312 ], [ -87.046695263, 37.420344022 ], [ -87.02443078, 37.426901364 ], [ -87.002805722, 37.433395103 ], [ -86.983755596, 37.437797771 ], [ -86.944934395, 37.454596739 ], [ -86.919528512, 37.465756489 ], [ -86.906482247, 37.4710292 ], [ -86.895839242, 37.475198059 ], [ -86.884492429, 37.479271323 ], [ -86.861932696, 37.487413543 ], [ -86.845868614, 37.493205936 ], [ -86.829612284, 37.4986129 ], [ -86.812858138, 37.504509724 ], [ -86.79131463, 37.511903926 ], [ -86.762492681, 37.524375726 ], [ -86.74561837, 37.531767958 ], [ -86.73530152, 37.534871662 ], [ -86.730392003, 37.536437079 ], [ -86.725705655, 37.538124968 ], [ -86.677606135, 37.555165059 ], [ -86.657556088, 37.560213736 ], [ -86.646106267, 37.562989681 ], [ -86.61943009, 37.575711435 ], [ -86.593389063, 37.587682865 ], [ -86.585870296, 37.589600837 ], [ -86.555520562, 37.597258623 ], [ -86.546868824, 37.598931536 ], [ -86.526938942, 37.603052447 ], [ -86.506425408, 37.6077171 ] ] } },

A convenience store was heavily damaged. Several outbuildings were damaged in Newbern. The elementary school and an auto shop suffered roof damage. The tornado moved northeast, uprooting and snapping numerous trees along its path, and then moved into Gibson County. Peak winds were estimated at 135 mph in Dyer County. The tornado crossed from Dyer County into Gibson County and continued northeast, uprooting and snapping trees. Several homes had significant roof damage as the tornado moved across rural parts of the county. The tornado strengthened as it approached the city of Kenton causing significant damage to numerous homes. The tornado then crossed into Obion County. Peak winds were estimated at 140 mph in Gibson County. The tornado moved from Gibson County into the southeast corner of Obion County. The tornado uprooted and snapped trees along its path and heavily damaged a couple of homes on Sidonia Kenton Road. The tornado then crossed back into Gibson County. Peak winds were estimated at 125 mph in Obion County. The tornado tracked from Gibson County northeast into Weakley County. The tornado passed north of Sharon mainly uprooting and snapping trees. The tornado strengthened as it approached Dresden causing significant damage to several homes along Highway 89. The tornado was at its peak intensity as it moved through Dresden. Numerous homes and businesses were destroyed or damaged in Dresden. In total, 187 homes were damaged in Weakley County with 100 of those being complete losses. Twenty-one businesses were also affected across the county. The tornado continued northeast and moved into Henry County. Peak winds were estimated at 160 mph in Weakley County. The tornado crossed from Weakley County into Henry County. The tornado damaged or destroyed several homes near Cottage Grove. The tornado continued northeast toward Buchanan mostly uprooting and snapping trees. A few homes and mobile homes were damaged near Buchanan. As the tornado approached Kentucky Lake several mobile homes were significantly damaged. The tornado then crossed into Calloway County, Kentucky. Peak winds in Henry County were estimated at 150 mph. This long-track EF-3 tornado began in western Tennessee near Dyersburg (see Storm Data, Tennessee, Western). It crossed from the northeast corner of Henry County, Tennessee and barely clipped the Fort Heiman section of the Fort Donelson National Battlefield in the southeast extremity of Calloway County. There were numerous uprooted trees near the Kentucky Lake shoreline. Because much of the path remained over the waters of Kentucky Lake during its extremely brief time in Calloway County, the intensity and the path width are both very uncertain. The center of the tornado crossed Kentucky Lake into Stewart County, Tennessee (see Storm Data, Tennessee, Central) and then back into western KY in Christian County (see Storm Data, Kentucky, Western). This major, long-track EF-3 tornado first touched down in Newbern near Washington Street in west Tennessee. The tornado moved northeast, uprooting and snapping numerous trees along its path. Several homes had significant roof damage. The tornado initially produced EF-1 damage but while progressing northeast, it continued to strengthen to EF-3 as it approached Dresden. Several buildings and homes in downtown Dresden suffered significant damage or were completely destroyed. The tornado slightly weakened and moved northeast toward Paris Landing and eventually crossed the Tennessee River. 5 people were injured in west Tennessee. The tornado clipped the Fort Donelson National Battlefield area of extreme southeastern Calloway County, Kentucky where it blew down several trees, then crossed the Tennessee River into the Land Between the Lakes area of Stewart County and did massive tree damage to heavily wooded areas uprooting thousands of trees along its path. The tornado struck a well constructed single family brick home near Bear Creek where it took off the roof and top story. It then continued to travel northeast where it passed Indian Branch and Morgan Branch where it continued to uproot trees and destroyed some farm outbuildings, lifted the roofs off of some single and double wide mobile homes and completely flattened some barns and single wide structures. The most widespread and severe damage in Stewart County was between Indian Branch and Morgan Branch to the south of Bumpus Mills. The tornado then continued northeast across the far northwest corner of Fort Campbell Army Base continuing to blow down trees before moving into Kentucky. The tornado received a maximum rating of EF2 in Stewart County, and 4 people were injured. The tornado passed just south of the city of Lafayette, Kentucky where it immediately struck a barn and knocked down several electrical transmission lines. The tornado tracked northeast over mostly open country before causing significant damage to several homes off of Boddie Road and Darnell Road. More significant damage occurred to several homes, farm outbuildings, and structures on Palmyra Road. A mobile home was completely demolished and significant roofing damage was done to a brick home on Herndon Oak Grove Road. As the tornado approached Interstate 24, mostly tree damage was observed with a few structures impacted as well. Once the tornado crossed Fort Campbell Blvd, additional damage to electrical transmission lines was observed including over a dozen wood poles snapped. The tornado continued northeast causing mostly tree damage before completely destroying four tobacco barns and damaging three equipment garages off of Bradshaw Road. Two other buildings were also heavily damaged along with multiple silos destroyed. Damage estimates were in the millions according to the owners for just this one farm. The tornado then took straight aim for the city of Pembroke where significant tree damage was observed along with multiple houses with roof damage. Once the tornado moved out of Pembroke, two mobile homes were completely destroyed with the occupants injured. The tornado then crossed into Todd County where mostly tree damage and damage to farm/outbuildings were observed. The tornado then lifted just before impacting the city of Elkton where straight-line winds became dominant. The tornado received a maximum rating of EF2 in Christian County and EF1 in Todd County, and 4 people were injured. The next tornado then touched back down just to the east across the Todd/Logan County line. Total path length of this tornado was around 123 miles. It crossed from Stewart County, Tennessee into Christian County in the secured area of the Fort Campbell military reservation (see Storm Data, Tennessee, Central for the Stewart County portion of the track). The tornado passed only about half a mile southeast of the community of La Fayette on its way northeast across Interstate 24 and Fort Campbell Boulevard (U.S. Highway 41). Between La Fayette and I-24, several homes were destroyed (DI 2, DOD 6). The homes suffered complete destruction of the roof and/or attic. The walls were often damaged but remained standing. One house was moved from its foundation (DI 2, DOD 5). The occupants of the houses took shelter and generally escaped serious injury. A mobile home was destroyed (DI 3, DOD 9). A church sustained steeple damage. Significant damage occurred to the silos and irrigation system of a farm, where damage was estimated near 1 million dollars. A mile's worth of power poles were snapped on Fort Campbell Boulevard (U.S. 41) just one to two miles north of the I-24 interchange (DI 24, DOD 4). After crossing U.S. 41, the tornado struck Pembroke, where more significant structural damage occurred. A single-wide mobile home was destroyed (DI 3, DOD 9). The mobile home was not tied down. One person was injured at this site. At least one other mobile home was destroyed. Two barns were destroyed (DI 1, DOD 8). Roofs were completely removed from two houses. Elsewhere along the path east of Fort Campbell Boulevard, farm outbuildings and farm equipment were damaged or destroyed. The tornado was rated EF-2 in Christian County. Several damage sites were assigned a wind speed estimate of 125 mph, the highest in the county. The average path width in Christian County was about a mile, though it narrowed to about three-quarters of a mile toward the end of its life after crossing Highway 41. The tornado continued northeast of Pembroke before entering Todd County. It crossed into Todd County from Christian County near the city of Pembroke. The tornado was near the end of its life in Todd County, where it only received a rating of EF-1. In Todd County, dozens of trees were snapped or uprooted. Roofs were blown off several barns. At least one house and several other farm outbuildings sustained minor to moderate roof damage. The windows were blown out of a few structures. The tornado lifted about four miles west of Elkton. This tornado was on the ground for approximately 125 miles across western Tennessee and western Kentucky.

The tornado continued approximately 6 miles into Warren County before dissipating at 0114 CST. In Logan County, the supercell that had cycled down its tornado in eastern Todd County (but continued to produce wind damage northeast of Elkton) spun back up again soon after crossing the border into western Logan County. It quickly ramped up to EF-3 (140 mph) intensity with a damage swath roughly three quarters of a mile wide along Milton Sharp Rd. On the southern side, a family was home when a 2 by 4 narrowly missed the husband as the roof was being peeled off the middle of the house. On the north side, a large dairy farm was completely destroyed. As the tornado continued northeast, a wide swath of trees was snapped/uprooted along the edge of a forest on the southern edge of the vortex, while on the north edge a well built home had its second floor two-thirds thrown off. A male was in the other section when a 2 by 4 from the first floor came up and got lodged in his mattress. Another well built log cabin in this area lost its second floor roof. The tornado then turned more ENE in the Buena Vista Rd area. A doublewide manufactured home was completely destroyed here along with several outbuildings on the property. A male at the home received warning from family and heard the tornado approach, getting into a bath tub in the middle of the east side of the structure. After it hit, the home blew into a row of trees and the male remembers grabbing onto a tree southeast of his original location. He sustained injuries as medics had to get wood out of his legs. The tornado continued over to Lakewood Ln where a boy was in the second story of a house when the window imploded inward and moved the bed he was in. After this, the storm crossed US 431, impacting several trees along Hwy 1040 with EF1 level winds. It then moved to a row of mobile homes along H.C. Johnson Rd. Two of these homes were completely destroyed, with one blown into a row of trees south of its original point and another lifted up and over a tree just east of its original location. This may have been a mesovortex spinning around the main circulation. The tornado damage was widest at this location, roughly 0.8 mile. On the south side of the tornado, a mobile home was completely destroyed along Hwy 915 where it was spread out over the road. The resident was a female whose father insisted she stay the night at his place, with a basement, after hearing the messaging in the days before. That same mesovortex may have been what caused the collapse of an electric transmission line just east of Marshall Rd where there was little damage to surrounding trees. Farther north on that road a well built brick home had its roof taken off as well as the carport removed. The tornado continued to track along Hwy 79 towards the Chandlers Chapel area where the Methodist Church lost its steeple and had damage to several of the stained glass windows. A couple of homes had major damage here. A resident said he had at least 20 minutes of warning lead time ahead of the touchdown. There was additional damage along Turner Road and then 3 Poplars Rd. This survey ended soon after 3 Poplars Rd. Another survey was conducted in the far northeast corner of Logan County where a couple of long chicken barns were leveled. This tornado formed approximately 1 mile southwest of Crossroads near Watlington Road and tracked northeast for approximately 22 miles before exiting Logan County and into western Warren County. The tornado traveled just over 6 miles into Warren County before dissipating near Hicks Lane, just west of Morgantown Road.

The tornado first touched down in rural southwestern Warren County just south of the intersection of Wimpee Smith Road and Petros Browning Rd. It tracked to the northeast for approximately 26 miles before entering Edmonson County. The tornado continued approximately 3.6 miles into Edmonson before dissipating at 0138 CST. At the tornado's beginning in Warren County, the tornado twisted, snapped, topped and uprooted softwood and hardwood trees. The tornado was about 200 yards wide, with EF1 winds of 90 mph. Aerial photography confirmed the tornado was continuous in this rugged area of southwest Warren County. The tornado increased to EF2, between 120 and 125 mph, doing major damage to several older barns along Tommy Smith Road. It threw a 1700 pound cattle trailer, 300 yards into a creek ravine.The NWS drone showed a distinct narrow main funnel within the larger funnel. This 30 to 35 yard funnel was clearly seen scouring the corn field and produced the most concentrated damage. The narrow funnel crossed Browning Rd and hit a well constructed house. The only major part of the house that survived was an interior bathroom and hallway. Winds were estimated at 135 mph, and areas outside the narrow funnel had damage of 100 mph, and the entire overall width was 250 yards wide. The survey team found extensive tree damage along Van Meter Rd and Fuqua Rd and aerial photography confirmed the tornado was continuous in this rugged, mainly forested area. The tornado did minor roof damage to some homes along Blue Level Road with winds of 86 to 90 mph but did more substantial roof and side damage to several barns with winds of 90 to 95 mph. Based on drone technology, there appeared to be two distinct areas of damage, and likely had a smaller satellite tornado. There was extensive roof damage to the Zomi Agape fellowship center with insulation thrown both downwind and on the upwind side of the building. The tornado increased in speed when it was over Old Tramm Rd by Rembrandt Court and Powell Road. One house on Rembrandt Court was knocked off its foundation by the garage attachment and slid about 15 feet. Other homes were knocked down to just interior bathrooms and hallways remaining, but there were some foundation construction concerns. EF2 winds of 130 to 135 mph were evidenced in this area. Several houses were knocked down to the foundation, but there were foundation construction concerns. In addition, farm equipment from a barn on the right side of Powell St was thrown directly into homes on the left side of Powell Rd. The survey team found significant house damage to dozens of homes in the Creekwood subdivision. This included exterior collapsed walls, roofs blown off, foundations severely compromised, garages blown in, insulation blown on all four sides of houses, and garages severely damaged or destroyed. In fact, they were dozens of double garages damaged, where one garage door blew in and the other garage door blew out. There were hundreds of powerlines and snapped power poles down throughout the county. Trees were uprooted snapped and twisted facing in all directions. Dozens of cars were flipped, twisted, turned, and thrown into homes. 2 x 4s were thrown into the ground, like missiles. Several splintered boards were impaled into vehicle windshields, tires, and along the hood grills. Most of the damage was rated EF2 from 115 to 135 mph except for 8 homes near Mossy Creek. The survey team brought in engineers from WKU to look at 8 homes, which were wiped down to the foundation from Moss Creek to Mossy Stone. Engineers helped in determining winds speeds were 160 mph for these houses, a high EF3 rating. Tragically, several fatalities occurred in the subdivision area. The tornado was 250 yards wide in Creekwood, but increased to about 350 yards wide before crossing Veterans Parkway. The tornado crossed the William Natcher Parkway and hit large townhouses along Veterans Parkway. There were numerous windows shattered and some roof damage. One of the town houses was shifted off the foundation, but there were no bricks or other support on it. The tornado crossed Russellville Rd hitting many businesses. At Royal Motor Cars, several storage buildings were destroyed, major loss of roof panels at Cabreras Mexican restaurant and an auto parts store. At Plumbers Supply company at 2321 Russellville Rd. The garage was blown in and collapsed. The main building had a shifted foundation, and a partial collapse of some exterior cinderblock walls, tractors and trailers were twisted and flipped, and there was numerous power poles snapped. The Shell gas station had major damage to service station canopy and store, as well as walls of an Enterprise car rental. The tornado increased to quarter mile wide and went from EF2 of 130 mph, from Royal Motorcars to AutoZone, and then decreased to EF2, 115-120 mph and narrowed to 1/8th of a mile with major tree and roof damage along Lealand Street, Cedar Ridge, and University Drive. A fully loaded dumpster was thrown 250 yards. At Russell Road and Springhill Avenue, a Marathon gas station had its pumps destroyed, and most of the exterior walls were destroyed. The tornado missed Western Kentucky University by 225 yards, but debris was thrown all over the campus including some impaled debris into buildings. The tornado went along 31W including doing significant damage to roof at Bobas lounge, a liquor store, and a smoke shop. This was estimated to be 110 to 120 mph winds, and tornado width decreased to 250 yards by Walgreens and Taco Bell. The tornado, appeared to be slightly elevated, doing mainly tree damage, power poles, and house roofing and siding along Magnolia Ave and Nutwood St. It crossed Lehman, went along Covington, with wind speeds mainly of 95 to 110 mph. The owner of 708 Nutwood said, your warning saved our lives, as our house was violently shaking, but we sought shelter and lived. Much of the tree damage was facing from the northeast to the northwest. The tornado paralleled Cemetery Rd doing roof and gutter damage along with power lines and tree damage. The tornadoes speed and winds increased along Cherokee Dr. with roofs removed and large healthy hardwood trees uprooted. The width increased to 300 yards and speeds to 105 mph with width of 225 yards. The narrow 175 yard funnel, hit the Indian Hills golf course, twisting, snapping, and topping numerous pines and cedars with winds speeds of 86 to 90 mph. The tornado then crossed the Barren River and increased in speed along Old Porter Pike to EF2, between 111 and 120 mph. Huge diameter hardwood trees were snapped and uprooted, including several very tall oak trees. There was also extensive roof damage to some well built homes. It weakened as it approached exit 28, doing EF1 damage of 90-95 mph to Hucks gas station and damaged a very tall Wendys sign. On the north side of 31 W, a fully loaded 18 wheeler facing west, was knocked over and was dragged 15 yards to a northwesterly directly. Winds were increased to EF2, of 115 mph. At the Corvette plant there was significant roof damage, with metal sheeting, insulation, HVAC units, and other debris thrown hundreds of yards downwind. Light poles in the parking lot were snapped, One of the security checkpoints at the Corvette plant was totally destroyed with large sections of the building being thrown several hundred yards, and weighing over 100 pounds, striking several vehicles. Winds were mainly in the 110 to 120 mph range. The tornado continued to parallel I 65, just west of the interstate. It struck several homes at Bristow Rd and Friendship Rd. Most of the damage was done to roofs siding and gutters and destroyed a well- built greenhouse. Numerous power poles and lines were down and the debris pattern was facing from southeasterly, all the way to northwesterly. There was some barn and tree damage near Kelly Road and the CSX railroad crossing. Winds were 85 to 90 mph and width of 200 yards. The tornado really increased across the TransPark at Exit 30. A few metal building structures at the peak intensity of the tornado sustained heavy damage. The middle building totally collapsed. Analysis showed that building was well constructed, but the shearing force from the intense tornado ripped the metal frame from the anchoring plates of the building. Analysis of the third building showed the tornado had weakened some at this point, down to EF2 levels. The WSR-8D radar showed a Tornadic Debris Signature downstream of this area, which was lofted to around 18 kft, right at the high end of EF3 of 165 mph. The tornado weakened further downstream as it caused roofing and siding damage to several structures and tree damage into southeast Edmonson County. Civil Air Patrol imagery helped identify the end point of this tornado.This tornado formed approximately 1 mile north of Petros near Petros Browning Road and tracked northeast for approximately 26 miles before exiting Warren County and into southern Edmonson County. Civil Air Patrol assisted in surveying the tornado path in this rural part of Edmonson County. Scattered tree damage was observed from the western edge of the county to where the tornado dissipated, near Brownville Road.", "F_scale": 3.0, "Wind": 165.0, "Source": "NWS Storm Survey", "State1": "KY", "State2": null, "State3": null, "SPC_id": 620762.0, "NCEI_id": "997207, 997224" }, "geometry": { "type": "LineString", "coordinates": [ [ -86.618462853, 36.9159161 ], [ -86.562844567, 36.944457994 ], [ -86.491433435, 36.968600479 ], [ -86.423455529, 36.985056876 ], [ -86.406289392, 36.988347728 ], [ -86.387063317, 36.999316208 ], [ -86.365090661, 37.009186486 ], [ -86.347924523, 37.012476295 ], [ -86.323891931, 37.022344865 ], [ -86.303979211, 37.042626233 ], [ -86.262093835, 37.07714691 ], [ -86.219521813, 37.090293512 ], [ -86.209908776, 37.09796131 ], [ -86.150880297, 37.115669941 ] ] } },

Scattered tree damage was noted as the path continued into Monroe County, Kentucky, where it caused EF-0 damage to a barn and trees along Beech Groves Boles Road. The tornado continued to weaken as it moved northeast damaging a few trees before lifting near Verona Road east of Hestand, Kentucky. The path length in Tennessee was around 5.78 miles, with a total path length of 11.16 miles. This tornado developed in Clay County, Tennessee, on the northeast side of Hermitage Springs, before tracking northeastward and crossing into Monroe County, Kentucky (see Storm Data from the Nashville, Tennessee office for more information on the beginning portion of this tornado in Tennessee). A barn and several trees were damaged along Beech Grove-Boles Road, with estimated maximum wind speeds of 85 mph. Additional trees were damaged along Rhoton Cave Road and near the intersection of Highways 163 and 216 in Hestand. The tornado damaged a barn near the intersection of Vernon Road and Bailey Cemetery Road before lifting.", "F_scale": 1.0, "Wind": 105.0, "Source": "NWS Storm Survey", "State1": "TN", "State2": "KY", "State3": null, "SPC_id": 620791.0, "NCEI_id": "999753, 996925" }, "geometry": { "type": "LineString", "coordinates": [ [ -85.773822587, 36.580864174 ], [ -85.761291306, 36.586240017 ], [ -85.744908353, 36.59360991 ], [ -85.73452284, 36.598812597 ], [ -85.724480649, 36.602895254 ], [ -85.707636377, 36.608002579 ], [ -85.693367025, 36.612920104 ], [ -85.685234567, 36.616347546 ], [ -85.680942806, 36.618241516 ], [ -85.672306299, 36.623525128 ], [ -85.625614404, 36.652417119 ], [ -85.598792314, 36.654930451 ] ] } },
