Along Highway 45 the tornado snapped a few trees and damaged the roofs of a couple of houses. The tornado crossed the highway moving northeast and reached peak intensity as it hit homes along Killebrew Rd. Two homes and a detached garage along Killebrew Rd were destroyed down to their foundations, which were not anchored. One home was constructed of concrete block which collapsed. The other home was constructed of wood with a concrete block foundation. The 5 injuries noted came from these two homes. A truck was tossed from the detached garage and onto the homes. Several trees were uprooted and snapped, with other cars sustaining heavy damage. A large tree was uprooted behind the homes and thrown about 100 yards into the front yard. Two instances were noted of small metal pole projectiles lodged into trees. Another house nearby sustained heavy damage to the roof and had portions of the exterior walls fail. A propane gas tank was dislodged and moved at this location as well. Powerlines were knocked down and most trees were snapped or uprooted along this section of the path. After the tornado crossed Killebrew Rd, it headed northeast and appeared to weaken. Trees snapped and uprooted were observed along the rest of the track along Po Boy Lane, Pullen Rd, GA Highway 200, Big Pond Rd, County Rd 3, Billy Newberry Rd, County Rd 119, Patmos Milford Hwy, and Julia Jones Rd. Damage sustained in these areas were mostly tree damage along with a couple instances of minor roof damage. The tornado lifted in Baker County after crossing Julia Jones Rd. The tornado was rated as a high end EF2 with max estimated winds around 130 mph.", "F_scale": 2, "Wind": 130, "Source": "Emergency Manager", "State1": "GA", "State2": null, "State3": null }, "geometry": { "type": "LineString", "coordinates": [ [ -84.721127816, 31.2810297 ], [ -84.689542123, 31.304206572 ], [ -84.671346017, 31.318579237 ], [ -84.629117318, 31.364029343 ], [ -84.573842355, 31.388358112 ] ] } },

The tornado produced significant and extensive damage to large swaths of trees from the Trotter Road area right along the river, northeast to Campbell's landing road and to near the Marengo County line. Based on aerial footage of the extensive tree damage, the tornado was given an EF-2 intensity rating. A few river camp houses suffered roof damage. An older home on Campbell's Landing Road was heavily damaged and two people in the home suffered minor injuries. Adjacent modular homes suffered minor damage.

The tornado then began to cross the Delaware River enroute to Mercer County, New Jersey. The tornado which began in New Hope, Pennsylvania crossed the Delaware River and entered Mercer County, New Jersey, in the area of Washington Crossing. Multiple reports of residential tree damage were received from Washington Crossing, and the survey team observed tree damage along River Rd on the New Jersey side of the Delaware River. From there the tornado continued southeast and crossed Pleasant Valley Rd. The first indications of EF2 damage came on that road, with numerous large hardwood and softwood trees snapped, sheared, and/or uprooted. The tornado continued southeastward and crossed through Baldpate Mountain. Continued heavy tree damage was observed in this area. An access road to the top of the mountain was barely passable when the survey team reached it in late afternoon, after many hours of tree clearing work by local parks officials and private companies. Hundreds of trees were snapped or damaged on this mountain. Damage continued down the mountain through Fiddlers Creek Rd and Church Rd. The tornado path then crossed Washington Crossing State Park.

The tornado then moved over Barnegat Bay as a waterspout. It came ashore in the area of High Bar Harbor in Long Beach Twp.\nThe most severe damage was noted to a house on the corner of Antioch Rd and Arnold Blvd. This house was facing west-southwest, and had its entire roof structure lifted off and tossed one to two houses to the east. The house walls remained standing but most of the doors and windows on the east and west sides of the house were completely blown out, with significant damage to the inside of the house. A two- by-four from an adjacent house impaled the wall on the west side of the house. Eight people were in the house at the time the tornado hit, but they were able to take shelter in an interior closet, with only minor injuries sustained. In addition, on the north side of the house, a car in the driveway was pushed sideways several feet and their boat flipped into their neighbor's boat. The boat's trailer was tossed about 50 feet into a house just to the east. The degree and orientation of damage was consistent with tornadic winds of 115 to 120 mph, which is EF2 intensity.\nContinuing east-northeast, about a dozen homes on the south side of Arnold Blvd sustained significant uplift of roof material, siding damage or removal, collapse of porch, patio, and sunroom structures, and blown out windows. Several large trees were uprooted and lay pointing to the east-northeast, as well as downed power poles.\nThe tornado moved east or slightly north of east from Arnold Blvd, over an open salt marsh, before intersecting a few houses on the corner of Collier Rd and Sunset Blvd. The most significant damage was to a house on the northwest corner of Collier and Sunset, which sustained siding damage, partial roof removal, blowout of the storm surge walls on the basement level of the elevated structure, and a large tree uprooted and laying to the east-northeast. Power poles and large trees were downed on Sunset Blvd, adjacent to the High Bar Harbor Yacht Club. There was damage to several boats in the yacht club marina, but this was mainly due to lofted debris being tossed into the marina. The circulation then moved into the cove east of the marina.

Only four other EF2 or stronger tornadoes have occurred in the state in the past 10 years.\nOn Wednesday afternoon, a tornado that peaked in intensity with winds estimated at 125 mph traveled northeast along a path through Anne Arundel County and the City of Annapolis. It not only snapped numerous trees, but also produced significant structural damage to homes, businesses, and a school. Fortunately, there were no injuries reported, even though it tracked through a heavily populated area. Several eyewitnesses to the event reported getting the NWS Tornado Warning through their cell phone in advance, and sheltering in response to the warning.\nFrom the NWS storm survey, the first damage noted, and recorded touchdown point was in Owensville, Maryland, in southern Anne Arundel County, near the intersection of Sudley Road and Owensville Road. This included a large limb from a tree top over Sudley Road and several portions of large cedar trees snapped along Owensville Road. The tornado moved northeast across rural southern Anne Arundel County before crossing Mill Swamp Road. Here, about a quarter of a mile east of the intersection with Dove Farm Road, dozens of trees and large branches were snapped and uprooted in a path from southwest to northeast as far as you could see in either direction from the road. While the dominant direction of the tree damage was being blown down to the north or northeast, there were trees downed in multiple directions, and many were topped.\nThe tornado intensified further as it moved into the South River Colony community. Dozens of trees were downed along the easternmost portions of Monarch Drive. Homes near the intersection of Monarch Drive and Red Admiral Court were particularly hard hit by some of the strongest winds of the entire tornado path. Several had significant portions of their roof damaged or removed, and one home in the middle of the track was unroofed entirely. One resident in this area reported seeing the tornado as it approached. The tornado then crossed South River Golf Links before moving into a campus of school buildings that includes South River High School and the Center of Applied Technology South. There it damaged the upper parts of the football field grandstands and concessions stand, damaged the roof, and caused cosmetic damage to some of the upper portions of the Center of Applied Technology South. The schools were left structurally sound, and the staff and some students that were there were able to shelter without injury.\nThe tornado crossed Central Avenue around 2:11 PM and moved into Edgewater. Here it crossed the communities of Woodland Beach, Londontowne, and Edgewater Park. Dozens of trees and large branches were snapped, and portions of 5 to 10 roofs were noted to have been damaged. One home near the intersection of Millstone Drive and Oakwood Road had only damaged roof trusses remaining of its roof.\nThe tornado crossed the South River and moved through western portions of the City of Annapolis at peak intensity with winds estimated at 125 mph at 2:20 PM. Several trees were snapped along the path as it crossed Aris T. Allen Boulevard just east of the Annapolis Harbour Center shopping area. It crossed Forest Drive at the intersection of Parole Street. Several homes there sustained roof damage, and one home was unroofed entirely. As it crossed the area near the intersection of West Street and Lee Street, the most substantial structural damage was noted. A large warehouse building had the winds enter the south side of the building and blow out a large portion of the west side cinder block wall. The roof with large metal trusses was largely removed. A fast food restaurant had its sign entirely removed from its post. Another commercial building had its roof removed, significant upper portions of the cinder block building removed, and its large commercial sign post blown over. A strip mall across the street had its windows blown out and flat roof damaged. All the telephone poles and attached wires along this stretch of West Street were downed. Another commercial building had its windows blown out. Several eyewitnesses saw the tornado as it passed.\nAdditional residential roof damage occurred as the tornado moved north over Bowman Court. From here, the tornado crossed into the community of Admiral Heights. Affected were areas along Halsey Road and adjacent Cedar Park Road. Here, the wind did not directly cause any structural damage, but about a dozen trees were snapped. That included one large, healthy tree about two and a half feet in diameter. The tornado crossed Weems Creek and Rowe Boulevard, and then snapped several trees along Riverview Avenue.\nFinally, the tornado crossed US Route 50/301 a few hundred yards west of the Severn River Bridge, snapping trees on both sides of the highway. The final damage noted occurred at the end of Acorn Drive at the last residential property that sits on the shore of the Severn River. Several trees were snapped here. The tornado dissipated here, or as it crossed the Severn River. The survey team was not able to find any damage north of the Severn River, and video evidence from social media indicates the funnel dissipated here.", "F_scale": 2, "Wind": 125, "Source": "NWS Storm Survey", "State1": "MD", "State2": null, "State3": null }, "geometry": { "type": "LineString", "coordinates": [ [ -76.595513947, 38.849851128 ], [ -76.595589049, 38.852257482 ], [ -76.574850209, 38.883933549 ], [ -76.562404759, 38.917598945 ], [ -76.554079182, 38.933691242 ], [ -76.545753605, 38.948645123 ], [ -76.53262151, 38.972271166 ], [ -76.529617436, 38.977609293 ], [ -76.521034367, 38.986282892 ], [ -76.509790547, 38.997957212 ], [ -76.508726369, 39.001377328 ] ] } },

A path of tree damage was observed heading northeast along Joshua Rd and through Fort Washington State Park. Some minor shingle and siding damage to houses was also seen.\nDamage became more severe after the tornado crossed the Pennsylvania Turnpike. At this time the tornado also moved into a more residential area. Damage was observed along Montgomery Ave, Spring Ave, and Prospect Ave and numerous crossing streets of those. This mainly consisted of numerous snapped and uprooted trees with minor to moderate roofing and siding damage to a number of homes. The worst damage was observed slightly farther northeast in the area of Stuart Creek in Upper Dublin.
