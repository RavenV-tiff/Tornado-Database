This long-track tornado began west of Highway 82, where timber damage occurred to farms near the community of Independence. The tornado crossed Highway 82 and strengthened as a manufactured home was rolled along Autauga County Road 40. Over the next two miles, the tornado rapidly strengthened as it approached the Old Kingston community, where EF3 damage began along County Road 43. At this location, at least three manufactured homes were obliterated with their frames thrown up to 100 yards. A pickup truck was sent airborne and landed 120 yards to the northeast, where a shallow crater was formed by its impact. The tornado became deadly as it impacted several homes along Sandy Ridge Road. The frame of a manufactured home at the western end of the road was thrown 250 yards to the north-northeast and came to rest in a field. Just downstream, several manufactured homes in a cluster were shredded and thrown considerable distances. Trees were snapped off relatively close to the ground and partially debarked. In total, five fatalities occurred along Sandy Ridge Road at three separate residences. Similar damage continued to the northeast along County Road 140, where two fatalities occurred in two separate residences at the eastern end of the road. At least five manufactured homes were blown away with their frames thrown considerable distances. Several vehicles were picked up and thrown, and one pickup truck had its cab separated from the bed. From this area to County Road 42, the tornado caused massive tree damage and what appeared to be stands of debarked trees along Autauga Creek. In the three mile stretch of most severe damage from County Road 43 to County Road 42, wind speeds reached at least 150 mph. The tornado tracked across County Road 57 at a slightly weaker state, where numerous trees were snapped and uprooted with several homes sustaining significant roof damage with one site-built home also sustaining partial wall failure. The tornado crossed Interstate 65 where numerous trees were uprooted. In the Pine Level community, several homes sustained roof damage and a manufactured home was rolled off its foundation and onto County Road 68. Many trees were uprooted and snapped as the tornado crossed through the Pine Flat community. Additional homes sustained roof damage and other damage from fallen trees, and a manufactured home was rolled and destroyed. Residential structure damage intensified as the tornado neared the Autauga/Elmore county line where several site-built homes sustained a majority or entire roof removal along County Road 68 near Poplar Springs Road. The tornado crossed into Elmore County just north of Highway 68. National Weather Service meteorologists surveyed damage in northwest Elmore County and determined that it was consistent with an EF2 tornado, with maximum winds near 125 mph. This tornado originated in Autauga County and crossed into Elmore County just north of Tram Road. The tornado crossed near the intersection of Lightwood Road and Coosa River Road, where a manufactured home was rolled and destroyed and a home lost a major portion of its roof. The tornado then crossed the Coosa River, affecting Neely Road on the west bank and Kelly Road on the east bank, where several homes lost portions of their roofs. The tornado continued northeast and crossed Highway 29, where a residence lost a significant portion of its roof. As the tornado crossed Grays Ferry Road on the northeast side of Titus, a large number of pine trees were uprooted and snapped. Numerous trees were snapped and uprooted as the tornado tracked through northwest Elmore County and towards southern Coosa County. The tornado crossed into Coosa County just west of Highway 231. National Weather Service meteorologists surveyed damage in southern Coosa County and determined that it was consistent with an EF3 tornado, with maximum winds near 140 mph. This long track tornado began in Autauga County and tracked across northwest Elmore County and into southern Coosa County just west of Highway 231. Structural damage across Coosa County continued to consist of roof uplift or removal and damage from wind-blown debris and fallen trees. A manufactured home was destroyed near Highway 231 along with numerous uprooted trees. Radar showed a debris ball in southern Coosa County which matched ground observations of a truly extensive area of snapped pine trees along McKissick Road, located between the communities of Speed and Equality. The volume of snapped trees was enough to assign an EF3 rating for this segment of the tornado path. Additional significant damage occurred along County Road 18 where vehicles were moved or flipped, numerous trees were snapped, and site-built homes were heavily damaged with one destroyed. This was another area assigned EF-3 intensity. The tornado continued northeastward toward the Coosa/Tallapoosa county line where additional, relatively less intense timber damage was noted. The tornado crossed into Tallapoosa County about one mile south of Newman Road. National Weather Service meteorologists surveyed damage in central Tallapoosa County and determined that it was consistent with an EF3 tornado, with maximum winds near 140 mph. This long track tornado began in Autauga County and tracked across northwest Elmore County, southern Coosa County and into Tallapoosa about one mile south of Newman Road. Tornado damage continued into Tallapoosa County with a corridor of timber damaged observed along Cedar Creek and Elkahatchee Roads. Timber was snapped and uprooted and consistent with EF1 damage here. The tornado continued northeast crossing Highway 63 and approaching the Wind Creek State Park area. The tornado then moved toward Coven Abbett Highway and then Elbert Road. Several homes sustained damage here, some significant with roofs blown off, boat houses destroyed, and adjacent significant timber damage as dozens of large hardwood trees were snapped and uprooted. Areas impacted near here were Elbert Drive, Loblolly Lane, and Elbert Road. The tornado then crossed the northern section of Lake Martin before impacting additional lakefront homes. Numerous homes were damaged on River Run Road and the adjacent side streets. Some homes sustained significant damage with entire roofs blown away and exterior walls collapsed or removed. At least two homes were shifted from their foundation. The high-end EF-2 damage here could be partly due to the interaction of the tornado with the lake surface, as well as the exposed nature of these homes since most structures inland seemed to be sheltered from adjacent heavily wooded areas. The tornado also damaged homes along Lake Ridge Drive. The tornado continued northeast causing pockets of EF1 timber damage as it crossed Highway 280. The tornado then moved across the rest of Tallapoosa County causing mainly varying degrees of timber damage in the EF0 to EF1 range, including the Sessions area. The weakening tornado then crossed into Chambers County just north of Highway 118. National Weather Service meteorologists surveyed damage in western Chambers County and determined that it was consistent with an EF1 tornado, with maximum winds near 100 mph. This long track tornado began in Autauga County and tracked across northwest Elmore County, southern Coosa County, Tallapoosa County, and into Chambers County just north of Highway 118. The tornado continued northeast into Chambers County causing additional swaths of mainly timber damage in the EF0 to EF1 range. The tornado continued along County Road 114 for several miles before lifting just east of Highway 77.", "f_scale": 3, "wind": 150, "source": "NWS Storm Survey", "state_1": "AL", "state_2": null, "state_3": null, "spc_id": null, "ncei_id": "1076639, 1076640, 1076650, 1076651, 1076652", "tornado_type": "Tornado", "storm_morphology": "Supercell", "satellite_scar": "True" }, "geometry": { "type": "LineString", "coordinates": [ [ -86.731196149, 32.52123293 ], [ -86.709624686, 32.529051299 ], [ -86.686192908, 32.536830251 ], [ -86.67456285, 32.542474092 ], [ -86.66516439, 32.547755827 ], [ -86.656023421, 32.55278404 ], [ -86.646453299, 32.55853539 ], [ -86.63965772, 32.562728554 ], [ -86.624948485, 32.572171601 ], [ -86.621621205, 32.574138071 ], [ -86.618062875, 32.576141665 ], [ -86.61443219, 32.578527443 ], [ -86.612631676, 32.57921529 ], [ -86.61090219, 32.579583047 ], [ -86.610271333, 32.580848721 ], [ -86.608202391, 32.581651651 ], [ -86.607150965, 32.581995185 ], [ -86.606317536, 32.582266126 ], [ -86.605980651, 32.582500722 ], [ -86.605487661, 32.583251064 ], [ -86.603942172, 32.583500122 ], [ -86.603217976, 32.58371347 ], [ -86.602625208, 32.584035752 ], [ -86.601545307, 32.585266363 ], [ -86.600898874, 32.586166399 ], [ -86.599190167, 32.586771977 ], [ -86.597010069, 32.58754217 ], [ -86.596293009, 32.588368039 ], [ -86.591400083, 32.590486171 ], [ -86.590541153, 32.591965559 ], [ -86.590039044, 32.593534776 ], [ -86.587957649, 32.59394425 ], [ -86.58668199, 32.594310335 ], [ -86.585968523, 32.594829178 ], [ -86.585825956, 32.5956777 ], [ -86.584341086, 32.596126031 ], [ -86.582934258, 32.596683701 ], [ -86.578513975, 32.598863851 ], [ -86.572896358, 32.60201286 ], [ -86.564519285, 32.608686515 ], [ -86.560699338, 32.611410857 ], [ -86.556403965, 32.613939104 ], [ -86.55180776, 32.617418979 ], [ -86.550825232, 32.618209723 ], [ -86.549806845, 32.618739017 ], [ -86.54722839, 32.620703063 ], [ -86.546548003, 32.621345401 ], [ -86.545720181, 32.622299383 ], [ -86.54435136, 32.623549394 ], [ -86.542039296, 32.625001191 ], [ -86.540108987, 32.625910637 ], [ -86.535326621, 32.628572603 ], [ -86.533679745, 32.630344326 ], [ -86.529854021, 32.632415684 ], [ -86.528690836, 32.633707717 ], [ -86.526144385, 32.634587209 ], [ -86.524796847, 32.636480933 ], [ -86.518846235, 32.639773849 ], [ -86.513573906, 32.643171516 ], [ -86.50621018, 32.647673765 ], [ -86.500539265, 32.651555591 ], [ -86.497138224, 32.653764966 ], [ -86.492950401, 32.655543717 ], [ -86.490546079, 32.658224527 ], [ -86.485454521, 32.66046502 ], [ -86.478319845, 32.66312202 ], [ -86.472033641, 32.666623419 ], [ -86.467833302, 32.668479436 ], [ -86.458409808, 32.67191289 ], [ -86.452623389, 32.674212824 ], [ -86.445131085, 32.67782592 ], [ -86.431145153, 32.683573759 ], [ -86.416230283, 32.68950558 ], [ -86.395089111, 32.697443656 ], [ -86.389923177, 32.698882215 ], [ -86.385983906, 32.700090528 ], [ -86.371187052, 32.706796888 ], [ -86.367440901, 32.707534151 ], [ -86.363722465, 32.709135043 ], [ -86.356510005, 32.710639615 ], [ -86.352441094, 32.711459596 ], [ -86.350929222, 32.711822943 ], [ -86.335057697, 32.718320059 ], [ -86.328831396, 32.721003921 ], [ -86.325752221, 32.722239012 ], [ -86.31817945, 32.725477848 ], [ -86.308325908, 32.729123465 ], [ -86.30188503, 32.731354988 ], [ -86.292919299, 32.735468907 ], [ -86.284642897, 32.739037408 ], [ -86.275182746, 32.743381837 ], [ -86.269743226, 32.746222861 ], [ -86.26680263, 32.747463618 ], [ -86.263860247, 32.748824671 ], [ -86.248397312, 32.75624167 ], [ -86.24110528, 32.759620621 ], [ -86.233516416, 32.763086657 ], [ -86.230312071, 32.765028631 ], [ -86.227721057, 32.765878184 ], [ -86.222380779, 32.768146376 ], [ -86.217075369, 32.770068693 ], [ -86.213840627, 32.771745143 ], [ -86.186804125, 32.781752633 ], [ -86.156278463, 32.793395141 ], [ -86.140028955, 32.801370343 ], [ -86.13791001, 32.802493097 ], [ -86.136622549, 32.802795201 ], [ -86.114410254, 32.811027285 ], [ -86.044795709, 32.834017119 ], [ -86.019167681, 32.841443275 ], [ -85.984573053, 32.852870064 ], [ -85.959216766, 32.862529679 ], [ -85.941449814, 32.870063351 ], [ -85.928618126, 32.875650112 ], [ -85.899961871, 32.886669637 ], [ -85.887327593, 32.891174272 ], [ -85.874072723, 32.892300173 ], [ -85.858966522, 32.896876589 ], [ -85.827696577, 32.904620394 ], [ -85.816051178, 32.908370641 ], [ -85.803176575, 32.912946227 ], [ -85.779229812, 32.920547662 ], [ -85.769359283, 32.923897851 ], [ -85.758923724, 32.926637779 ], [ -85.743278357, 32.92983025 ], [ -85.729420439, 32.932604612 ], [ -85.705637286, 32.938636753 ], [ -85.682131009, 32.946173808 ], [ -85.641409648, 32.954760915 ], [ -85.60521538, 32.972054071 ], [ -85.563360067, 32.981943658 ], [ -85.548356864, 32.984895548 ], [ -85.533387989, 32.988552868 ], [ -85.515951464, 32.992789498 ], [ -85.455181214, 33.006904677 ] ] } },
{ "type": "Feature", "properties": { "id": 2, "fid": 23, "start_time": "2023-01-12T21:10:00", "end_time": "2023-01-12T21:45:00", "width": 2200, "length": 30.98, "fatalities": 0, "injuries": 18, "damage": null, "narrative": "New high resolution areal imagery in concert with a reanalysis of radar data, areal surveys and ground surveys it has been determined that there were multiple tornadoes on the ground simultaneously in southwest Spalding and Northwestern Pike Counties as well as crossing tornado paths. The tornadoes were part of a larger mesocyclone which can be traced west all the way back to the Selma Alabama tornado. Our analysis determined that this tornado would become the dominant circulation which impacted Griffin and much of Spalding County and Southern Henry County. The tornado first touched down in Northwest Pike County along HWY 362 west of Irish Hill Drive where a few trees were snapped and uprooted and quickly increased in intensity to EF1 as it crossed Kings Bridge Road, Huff Creek Rd and Scott Road where numerous trees were snapped and uprooted. As the storm crossed Blanton Mill Road more severe damage was noted both on the ground and areal survey and it was determined that EF2 damage was present in the area around Nunnally Rd and Bethany Road where widespread snapping of trees occurred and a few structures were severely damaged. However, the updated analysis shows that this area also experienced crossing tornado paths both from this tornado and another which struck the area approximately 2 minutes later. The combination of the 2 paths likely resulted in more intense damage indicators. As the storm continued north into southern Spalding County, the circulation briefly weakened causing only sporadic low end EF0 damage northward along Scott Barch Road. It should also be noted that this circulation would pass into southern Spalding County along Scott Barch Road just 2 minutes ahead of another EF1 tornado to cross its path coming in from the west. The tornado continued north crossing Scott Barch Road and uprooting trees in an area south of Blanton Mill Road. Per both radar data and damage on the ground the tornado would pivot within the larger mesocyclone in an area north of Blanton Mill and begin its track east crossing Rover Zetlla Road destroying a barn. It was near this point the tornado and the wind damage would significantly increase as the tornado was intensifying rapidly. The tornado would quickly reach peak intensity of 150-155 mph and several homes were completely destroyed along Kendall Drive and West Road. 2 homes in particular were noted to be completely destroyed down to the foundation however further inspection of the homes revealed that the walls were not anchored fully anchored into the concrete thus a higher rating could not be determined from those homes. The resident of one of those homes rode out the storm in his bathtub, however the bathtub and all plumbing fixtures were torn away from the slab and tossed into the nearby woods. The survivor of the home was miraculously uninjured and got out to help neighbors. Further west along Kendall Drive several homes were also completely destroyed with several others suffering major damage thus the EF3 rating. The damage along West Road in particular garnered a slight upgrade in the wind speed to high end EF3 damage per a reanalysis. Major to severe damage was also noted along Maloy Road, Hwy 16, areas around Griffin High School, The club at Shoal Creek and North Pine Hill Road. As the tornado approached Hwy 19, per UGA faculty, the UGA facility at Dempsey Farm recorded a wind speed of 81.1 mph before the anemometer/wind combo instrument blew off the tower. The tornado continued ENE through the community of Experiment to the NW of the town of Griffin crossing HWY 92 where numerous business and homes suffered damage either from wind or fallen trees consistent with EF0 through EF1 damage. A weather instrument on the south end of the tornado swath at the UGA Griffin Campus recorded a 73.9 mph wind gust as the storm passed by. Damage in the area was consistent with EF0 type wind damage. The tornado struck a Hobby Lobby building in an around Experiment St and Hwy 92 which suffered severe damage to the roof, and exterior walls on the northeast side. Damage to the building was consistent with EF2 winds of approximately 130 mph. The tornado continued Northeast through the northside of Griffin with mostly EF0-EF1 type wind damage. Pockets of more severe damage were noted along Northside Drive and McIntosh Road consistent with high end EF1 damage. The tornado continued northeast crossing Smoak Road and N. McDonough road where it was noted both on the ground and from the air that the circulation weakened and the damage become more sporadic in nature particularly the area from Amelia rd eastward to I75 in southern Henry County. Once the circulation crossed I75 intensity of the tornado increased to a mid to high end EF1 with damage in the city of Locust Grove. The tornado crossed LG Griffin Road where it impacted numerous homes in a subdivision and snapped or uprooted trees. The storm crossed Stanley K Tanger Road and through another neighborhood affecting several homes including some high end EF1 damage. As the storm crossed Hwy 23 numerous trees were snapped or uprooted and a new TDS appeared on radar. The tornado continued NE across Jackson St, Grove Park Drive, Skyland Dr, S. Unity Grove Road and S Ola grove road snapping and uprooting trees as well as causing EF0 or in some cases EF1 damage to homes. The storm continued ENE snapping and uprooting trees through Peaksville Road where it shortly there after become less defined and eventually merged with the circulation/tornado ongoing to the south in the Jenkinsburg area.", "f_scale": 3, "wind": 155, "source": "NWS Storm Survey", "state_1": "GA", "state_2": null, "state_3": null, "spc_id": null, "ncei_id": "1079333, 1079334, 1079335", "tornado_type": "Tornado", "storm_morphology": "QLCS", "satellite_scar": "True" }, "geometry": { "type": "LineString", "coordinates": [ [ -84.478492481, 33.165382197 ], [ -84.468538816, 33.167742883 ], [ -84.456262333, 33.173357011 ], [ -84.453883226, 33.177073452 ], [ -84.450997169, 33.179659612 ], [ -84.448108417, 33.181115593 ], [ -84.441284878, 33.182552293 ], [ -84.430856449, 33.185928443 ], [ -84.423509891, 33.189089921 ], [ -84.419097645, 33.192824005 ], [ -84.417188064, 33.195006577 ], [ -84.414870636, 33.197053542 ], [ -84.410721118, 33.203212161 ], [ -84.403133137, 33.217959476 ], [ -84.400673703, 33.226181686 ], [ -84.39914201, 33.227903948 ], [ -84.397339565, 33.23030912 ], [ -84.395791081, 33.23202131 ], [ -84.395372656, 33.232245665 ], [ -84.394975689, 33.232308485 ], [ -84.394610909, 33.231734135 ], [ -84.393949253, 33.231386041 ], [ -84.391639021, 33.230612346 ], [ -84.384536532, 33.229966189 ], [ -84.377727253, 33.229519369 ], [ -84.37111829, 33.23030912 ], [ -84.366955501, 33.231134761 ], [ -84.35867284, 33.233611636 ], [ -84.353136761, 33.235406429 ], [ -84.347944004, 33.236447393 ], [ -84.338465077, 33.237062094 ], [ -84.335482461, 33.237878697 ], [ -84.332950456, 33.239188836 ], [ -84.32903443, 33.241880841 ], [ -84.307705504, 33.253814396 ], [ -84.299508674, 33.259080793 ], [ -84.297341449, 33.261503049 ], [ -84.294538553, 33.268373417 ], [ -84.289496, 33.270903058 ], [ -84.286427553, 33.2720333 ], [ -84.281256254, 33.273199407 ], [ -84.277839119, 33.273468507 ], [ -84.265283687, 33.274312977 ], [ -84.257191474, 33.276428546 ], [ -84.252760465, 33.279836951 ], [ -84.243740184, 33.283641154 ], [ -84.23373018, 33.289919174 ], [ -84.229846341, 33.290932583 ], [ -84.21953593, 33.293300148 ], [ -84.212087447, 33.29598022 ], [ -84.19657622, 33.305549479 ], [ -84.180120868, 33.311343997 ], [ -84.165894431, 33.316288646 ], [ -84.153550918, 33.318360611 ], [ -84.149345214, 33.319113698 ], [ -84.144753272, 33.320081942 ], [ -84.14010231, 33.323285989 ], [ -84.134158534, 33.325571995 ], [ -84.130757493, 33.327293183 ], [ -84.121090812, 33.328234443 ], [ -84.117705864, 33.328799194 ], [ -84.111955221, 33.330328534 ], [ -84.109165723, 33.330929129 ], [ -84.101047501, 33.333256909 ], [ -84.098472581, 33.334906236 ], [ -84.095468507, 33.335479908 ], [ -84.088087067, 33.337559436 ], [ -84.068603501, 33.340857897 ], [ -84.061307893, 33.345231749 ], [ -84.047686798, 33.356911116 ], [ -84.037601692, 33.364044086 ], [ -84.02489875, 33.366947288 ], [ -84.007947189, 33.372753402 ], [ -84.002110702, 33.373398502 ], [ -84.001424057, 33.373434341 ] ] } },

Satellite imagery indicates major tree damage of EF2 intensity. It continued northeast before crossing Highway 430, CR 235, and Highway 17. In this area, numerous residential structures were damaged, including 2 homes that were destroyed, with both losing outer walls and another with collapsed brick on the exterior with the interior slab exposed. Large farming equipment was also blown over on the side. No injuries were reported in this area. The tornado was strongest just northeast of here at EF3 intensity, around 155mph, where Black Hawk Independent Church, Historic Blackhawk School and parsonage were completely destroyed. Both the school and church had stood for nearly 100 years. The church steeple was gone with the bell thrown out and not seen by the survey team. The slab to the church remained intact with a few exterior walls standing. A nearby well building made of cinder block masonry stood mostly untouched outside of minor damage to the roof and doorway. The tornado then continued to the northeast before crossing Highway 17 where widespread tree damage and some structural damage continued. It then continued northeast, just north of Highway 243, before crossing Highway 218 and Nebo Rd, where widespread tree damage occurred. Some areas beyond this were inaccessible due to fallen trees. Satellite imagery indicates potential EF2 to EF3 tree damage in the nearby wooded area. The tornado crossed CR 144, CR 163, CR 211, Good Hope Rd and Spring Lake Rd between Burkhead Lake, Spring Lake and Water Lake. In this area, the tornado was an estimated one half to three quarters of a mile wide and caused EF2 to EF3 tree damage to the forested areas. Some damage was noted to structures along these inaccessible areas. It then crossed Enon Rd, where damage was noted to a home, and Highway 35, where widespread tree damage, major roof, and minor siding damage occurred to a mobile home. One mobile home just north of Highway 35 was thrown off the blocks and into a nearby wooded area some 50 yards away. In this location, 3 fatalities occurred. An 18 wheeler tractor trailer was also blown over on the side. Just to the northeast, satellite imagery indicates a structure had major damage, with the majority of it destroyed. The tornado then crossed CR 278 and CR 61, with minor tree damage, but the majority of the more intense tree damage as viewed within satellite imagery occurred in inaccessible areas just to the north. It then crossed Gum Branch Rd before crossing Interstate 55, where ground surveys and satellite imagery indicated the tornado was nearly a half mile wide. The tornado then crossed Highway 51, Stafford Wells Rd and Highway 407, where major roof damage occurred to residential homes consistent with EF2 intensity. The tornado then crossed Highway 82, where numerous power lines were downed, causing high end EF1 to low end EF2 damage. The tornado then crossed the intersection of Bethlehem Community Rd and Bethlehem Church Rd, where EF2 damage occurred. Three outbuildings were destroyed. A home had major roof damage, and another structure moved off the foundation. The tornado then crossed Hammond Rd, causing major tree damage in the wooded areas. The tornado then caused low end EF2 damage just south of Robinson-Thompson Rd, where an outbuilding was destroyed and a nearby 100 year old home had minor to moderate roof and siding damage but was left standing.

In the course of the next 1.25 miles, the tornado would rapidly intensify to EF3 as it moved into North West Point. West Point Road or Hwy 29, sustained the most significant damage with several homes completely leveled and many sustaining major damage. Of the 4 homes completely leveled, it was noted that the anchoring of the walls to the concrete slab was through the use of nails. As a result, the destroyed homes would have failed at lower wind speeds than EF4 thus a rating of EF3 was determined. Other homes with major damage nearby also suggested a mid range EF3 within the core of the strongest winds. The area of most significant damage was located between West Point Road, 1st Ave and Samples Rd. Significant damage was also noted along Ann Murphy Rd to the west of Hwy 29. The tornado continued east across mostly wooded area until it reached Kia Pkwy and I85 where a large swath of trees were snapped and uprooted. It should be noted that the tornado passed 0.75 miles south of the Kia Manufacturing plant along Kia Pkwy.

The tornado continued east snapping trees along White Road before crossing I185 snapping trees along both sides of the Interstate. As it crossed Oak Grove Road, EF1 to EF2 damage was noted to both trees and most notably the Pine Mountain Wild Animal Safari where several tigers had escaped as a result of the tornado. The tornado continued east crossing Hamilton Road (Hwy 27) and Old Chipley road snapping and uprooting many trees noted as mostly EF1 damage. As the tornado crossed into the Cherokee Resort club near the Troup County Line, more than 40+ cabins sustained damage with several cabins destroyed. The tornado damage in some sections of the resort was rated as EF2. The tornado continued into Meriwether county crossing Dallas Mill road where it began to weaken rapidly. The last location of damage was located along Robert Williams Road where a couple snapped trees were found.

The primary damage in Wapello County consisted of three homes and one hog confinement facility. The first home lost the entire roof and one external wall. The first failure point was likely the wind entering and lifting the garage which then led to failure of the roof. The home only had straight nailed connections to the external walls spaced every 18 inches and less to the roof. An unoccupied mobile home on the property was not well anchored and rolled to total destruction. This location was rated 110 mph and EF-1. Two well anchored hog confinement buildings were totally destroyed and were rated EF-2. The tornado then impacted a location with a well built 2 story brick house. The house suffered some roof and window damage and a loss of a garage door but sustained little other damage. Other damage indicators at the site suggested EF-1 winds. Total destruction of a house occurred just prior to the tornado exiting the county. This older house sat unanchored to the concrete block basement. The house was pushed off the foundation and crumbled. Some trees near the house and a propane tank were mostly left with little damage. A larger tree directly next to the house on the wind side had several large limbs removed. Due to all of these reasons, the wind at this location has been rated at 135 mph, or high end EF-2. A large violent tornado developed in Wapello County (see NWS Des Moines Storm Data) and tracked into Keokuk County about 1 mile southeast of Martinsburg on Wapello-Keokuk Road. The tornado continued to the northeast before lifting just north of Highway 92, southwest of Keota. The tornado produced EF-3 damage to a house northeast of Martinsburg, and caused additional significant damage to farmsteads and outbuildings. The tornado was on the ground in Keokuk County for about 17 miles, with a maximum width of 1000 yards and peak estimated winds of 150 MPH.", "f_scale": 3, "wind": 150, "source": "NWS Storm Survey", "state_1": "IA", "state_2": null, "state_3": null, "spc_id": null, "ncei_id": "1087584, 1087052", "tornado_type": "Tornado", "storm_morphology": "Supercell", "satellite_scar": "True" }, "geometry": { "type": "LineString", "coordinates": [ [ -92.333397837, 41.061496016 ], [ -92.323827716, 41.074567504 ], [ -92.32065198, 41.078514324 ], [ -92.318420382, 41.081166971 ], [ -92.315652342, 41.083576905 ], [ -92.312884303, 41.086116136 ], [ -92.310008975, 41.088639097 ], [ -92.304365607, 41.093393643 ], [ -92.29852912, 41.097953804 ], [ -92.295975657, 41.100233765 ], [ -92.29355094, 41.102659169 ], [ -92.290954562, 41.105941407 ], [ -92.288722964, 41.108657617 ], [ -92.280689747, 41.117066648 ], [ -92.276484046, 41.121411794 ], [ -92.272329302, 41.12569604 ], [ -92.265072853, 41.133694812 ], [ -92.261235686, 41.138560836 ], [ -92.259368868, 41.141000983 ], [ -92.257351847, 41.143327927 ], [ -92.256021472, 41.144782225 ], [ -92.254691096, 41.146107224 ], [ -92.253382178, 41.147496828 ], [ -92.251751395, 41.14862788 ], [ -92.249906035, 41.15001743 ], [ -92.248060675, 41.151229224 ], [ -92.244404826, 41.153331228 ], [ -92.242717715, 41.154282844 ], [ -92.241151305, 41.155252218 ], [ -92.239670725, 41.156205421 ], [ -92.238336596, 41.157299164 ], [ -92.237009974, 41.158612602 ], [ -92.235759181, 41.159923692 ], [ -92.234482449, 41.161240308 ], [ -92.233187651, 41.162521187 ], [ -92.205571373, 41.184397124 ], [ -92.200335702, 41.190573795 ], [ -92.191752633, 41.199615713 ], [ -92.184199532, 41.208785526 ], [ -92.17389985, 41.2187288 ], [ -92.161711892, 41.227379509 ], [ -92.138365945, 41.245710067 ], [ -92.123431405, 41.259648176 ], [ -92.110728463, 41.266358056 ], [ -92.091159066, 41.281839765 ], [ -92.075881203, 41.292545798 ], [ -92.072051425, 41.295976383 ], [ -92.068446536, 41.30161862 ], [ -92.066000362, 41.303907617 ], [ -92.063082118, 41.305551776 ], [ -92.054413219, 41.310258356 ], [ -92.044252594, 41.315669026 ], [ -92.032665452, 41.322598755 ], [ -92.026786049, 41.327529695 ], [ -92.014083107, 41.336262666 ], [ -92.002152642, 41.341192572 ] ] } },

The tornado tracked to the east-northeast towards Wynne, AR where it crossed Highway 284 multiple times. EF-2 damage was observed north of Ellis Chapel and McElroy. Just east northeast of McElroy, significant EF-2 damage to the sewage treatment plant was noted where an 80-yard-long shed with a sturdy roofing structure of metal failed and became lofted. The roofing wadded up and destroyed two cinder block buildings before landing 100 yards away. The tornado strengthened to an EF-3 as it moved into the western section of Wynne, AR. The tornado then ravaged the center of Wynne, including the Wynne High School. Several one and two-family residences in Wynne were partially to completely destroyed. The tornado weakened as it moved away from Wynne and traveled to the north of Parkin, AR where EF-2 damage was observed. The tornado then crossed into Crittenden County. Peak winds in Cross County were estimated at 150 mph. The tornado that caused EF-3 damage in Wynne, Arkansas moved into Crittenden County just north of Earle causing EF-2 damage along Watson Road. Between Earle, AR, and the Mississippi River, very few damage indicators aided in the observed strength as it traversed mostly farmland. There were between 20 to 30 center pivot irrigation systems that were overturned along this area. The tornado then tracked into the oxbows of the Mississippi River while crossing into Tipton County. Peak winds were estimated at 125 mph in Crittenden County. The tornado that tracked through Wynne, Arkansas eventually moved from through the oxbows of the Mississippi River crossing between Tennessee and Arkansas a couple of times. Significant tree damage along the Mississippi River occurred. As the tornado passed over Corna Lake in Tipton County (the west side of the Mississippi River) and extreme southern Mississippi County, EF- 3 damage was observed. Peak winds were estimated at 145 mph in this part of Tipton County. The tornado then crossed the Mississippi River into Tipton County, Tennessee. Peak winds were estimated at 145 mph in Mississippi County. The tornado that heavily damaged Wynne, Arkansas crossed the Mississippi River into Tipton County, Tennessee where it produced EF-2 damage across Wilder Farms. As the tornado climbed the Bluff, the tornado circulation began to weaken. From the top of the Bluff at the intersection of Pryor and Leach Roads to south of Burlison where the tornado appears to have lifted, EF-1 and EF-0 damage was observed. Peak winds from this tornado in Tipton County were estimated at 130 mph. It is important to note that as the long-tracked Wynne, Arkansas tornado was dissipating, the Covington, Tennessee tornado was on the ground approximately 3.5 miles away to the south.", "f_scale": 3, "wind": 150, "source": "NWS Storm Survey", "state_1": "AR", "state_2": "TN", "state_3": null, "spc_id": null, "ncei_id": "1089126, 1089127, 1089128, 1089129, 1089130, 1089131, 1089134", "tornado_type": "Tornado", "storm_morphology": "Supercell", "satellite_scar": "True" }, "geometry": { "type": "LineString", "coordinates": [ [ -90.961486694, 35.181839662 ], [ -90.898660815, 35.197136605 ], [ -90.886129535, 35.201344811 ], [ -90.874799884, 35.206254109 ], [ -90.862268603, 35.210602097 ], [ -90.849222339, 35.213968121 ], [ -90.835146106, 35.217614489 ], [ -90.823129809, 35.219858327 ], [ -90.812830127, 35.222242336 ], [ -90.801854019, 35.224731167 ], [ -90.790846233, 35.227640877 ], [ -90.784672974, 35.228811603 ], [ -90.781411408, 35.229477657 ], [ -90.778965234, 35.229933375 ], [ -90.776647805, 35.230318981 ], [ -90.774620409, 35.230875488 ], [ -90.773075456, 35.231296143 ], [ -90.767500285, 35.23468685 ], [ -90.765011195, 35.235773488 ], [ -90.760805492, 35.23735084 ], [ -90.757930164, 35.238051876 ], [ -90.755355243, 35.238928161 ], [ -90.749347095, 35.241662112 ], [ -90.723907349, 35.250278959 ], [ -90.677215454, 35.260932344 ], [ -90.601684448, 35.275508391 ], [ -90.550103912, 35.284371666 ], [ -90.525556336, 35.290256759 ], [ -90.496627686, 35.296246706 ], [ -90.451309082, 35.301850744 ], [ -90.398437378, 35.308014737 ], [ -90.371658203, 35.313057655 ], [ -90.313293335, 35.332666015 ], [ -90.232873688, 35.353704493 ], [ -90.20197464, 35.363224358 ], [ -90.17802417, 35.372988255 ], [ -90.142318604, 35.392022314 ], [ -90.110046265, 35.40601508 ], [ -90.081893799, 35.416647958 ], [ -90.053741333, 35.426160396 ], [ -90.03588855, 35.428957959 ], [ -90.018885525, 35.433228191 ], [ -90.001032742, 35.440501013 ], [ -89.989703091, 35.446654425 ], [ -89.980433376, 35.452807367 ], [ -89.974253567, 35.456442976 ], [ -89.96841708, 35.459239486 ], [ -89.949534328, 35.469026505 ], [ -89.921725185, 35.478253176 ], [ -89.889109524, 35.489435599 ], [ -89.865076931, 35.500895969 ], [ -89.841387661, 35.51123685 ], [ -89.75521365, 35.539178513 ] ] } },

The tornado then crossed Cattle Branch Creek causing minor tree damage. The first structural damage occurred along Laxton Lane and Fite Road where houses had some minor roof damage. The tornado began to intensify as it crossed Akins Road and approached Marshall Drive. A few power poles were broken in this area. The first EF-3 damage occurred along Myron Creek Drive where significant structural damage occurred to a couple of well-built homes. The tornado crossed Indian Creek Canal and continued to cause major damage to homes and trees along Indian Creek Road and Wright Lane. The lone fatality of the tornado occurred in this area. The tornado continued east-northeast toward Highway 51, where it damaged trees and structures along Jack Bennett and Liberty Church Smith Road. The tornado widened to over one-half mile wide as it approached and crossed Highway 51. Several homes were completely destroyed in this area and dozens of homes had significant damage. Several businesses along Highway 51 suffered heavy damage. EF-3 damage was widespread in this area. Fifty-three power poles had to be replaced along Highway 51 south of Covington. The tornado then moved across the southern section of Covington. This area is mostly industrial and several businesses suffered significant damage along Highways 59 and 384. A metal truss tower was crumpled to the ground. The tornado damaged the middle and elementary schools along Mark Walker Jr. Drive where the elementary school suffered major damage to the gymnasium and several walls. The tornado then crossed South Main Street and Highway 179 damaging several more houses. Substantial damage was caused to several houses along Highway 54. One house was completely destroyed and a couple of large metal power poles were bent to the ground. The tornado widened to almost a mile as it tracked east-northeast just north of Highway 54. This area is rural and the last major structural damage in Tipton County was on Lindsey Road where a home suffered major roof damage. The strong tornado continued tracking east-northeast taking out several large metal power poles and snapping trees between farm fields. Several irrigation pivots were overturned and twisted. In total, over 500 structures were damaged in Tipton County, 62 of which were total losses. The tornado began to weaken across northeast Tipton County as it tracked toward the Hatchie River. The tornado continued into Haywood County. Peak winds in Tipton County were estimated at 150 mph. The tornado that destroyed parts of Covington continued into Haywood County causing significant tree damage along Estes Lane. A mobile home suffered significant damage along Fulton Road. Minor tree damage continued for a few more miles and then the tornado lifted north of Brownsville. Minor damage was observed on Gillespie Road and Highway 54 North with the tornado lifting just east of Sturdivant Road. Peak winds in Haywood County were estimated at around 105 mph.", "f_scale": 3, "wind": 150, "source": "NWS Storm Survey", "state_1": "TN", "state_2": null, "state_3": null, "spc_id": null, "ncei_id": "1089395, 1089396", "tornado_type": "Tornado", "storm_morphology": "Supercell", "satellite_scar": "True" }, "geometry": { "type": "LineString", "coordinates": [ [ -89.832308431, 35.462084044 ], [ -89.805872579, 35.472150319 ], [ -89.774973532, 35.4816562 ], [ -89.761192367, 35.487746278 ], [ -89.74868486, 35.49553877 ], [ -89.742223785, 35.501163414 ], [ -89.735810257, 35.505286435 ], [ -89.706995626, 35.516874073 ], [ -89.680216451, 35.527492305 ], [ -89.656183859, 35.537829761 ], [ -89.635927816, 35.543975724 ], [ -89.607432028, 35.553193787 ], [ -89.576288921, 35.560688848 ], [ -89.562212689, 35.563202446 ], [ -89.547106487, 35.565017774 ], [ -89.5337169, 35.566972696 ], [ -89.522043926, 35.569346465 ], [ -89.507967693, 35.573395675 ], [ -89.495436413, 35.578701225 ], [ -89.485823376, 35.584564846 ], [ -89.478441937, 35.588613286 ], [ -89.467455608, 35.593499062 ], [ -89.389078756, 35.617690542 ], [ -89.359552999, 35.624388524 ], [ -89.326250692, 35.628853534 ], [ -89.283163686, 35.641968058 ], [ -89.228060384, 35.656335757 ], [ -89.183771749, 35.669585226 ] ] } },

The tornado tracked northeastward, causing sporadic tree damage before crossing into western Crawford County between East 500th Avenue and East 600th Avenue at 9:03pm CDT. This tornado crossed into western Crawford County from Jasper County at 9:03pm CDT. The tornado tracked northeastward, doing minor structural damage to a machine shed along County Highway 1 near Pierceburg. Numerous wooden power poles were snapped and heavy damage to trees was noted with tops sheared off about 30 feet above ground. Structural damage to homes of the EF1-EF2 variety occurred as the tornado moved across County Highway 15 where two single family homes sustained major roof damage. A mobile home was torn in half with its debris strewn about 20 yards in opposite directions. Trees, while sparse in this area, were sheared about 20-30 feet above the ground. Further east along County Highway 15, structural damage occurred to a large machine shed where a stationary semi-trailer blew into its west-facing wall causing the entire structure to fail. The debris from the large machine shed then blew into an old, poorly anchored single-family residence and caused exterior walls to slide off its foundation. Over the next 3 miles along the path of the tornado just before it reached the south side of Robinson, considerable tree damage was observed.\nAs the tornado tracked into the south side of Robinson, it narrowly missed a major oil refinery. The tornado destroyed two manufactured homes resulting in two fatalities as it crossed County Highway 9 near the interchange of East 900th Avenue and North 1200th Street. Damage to structures, trees, and wooden power poles was determined to be EF1-EF2.\nHeavy structural damage (EF3) and an additional fatality were noted on the east side of Robinson near the interchange of State Highway 1 and East 1050th Avenue where a two-story masonry building experienced failure to its top story walls. The adjacent properties also experienced heavy damage where the exterior walls of two single-family homes collapsed. Damage to trees and utility poles in this area was extensive due to the amount of debris strewn toward the northeast.\nThe tornado then moved over Robinson Municipal Airport, destroying airport hangers and a small outbuilding. The progressive collapse of the rigid frames of the metal building systems, which included steel beams measuring greater than 18 inches in diameter, caused the survey team to estimate EF3 damage at this point.\nA continuous track of EF1 damage then extended northeastward across County Highway 5 where multiple single-family homes exhibited large sections of their roof structures removed. In addition, multiple large machine sheds experienced a collapse of their wall structures.\nThe survey team concluded that the storm likely maintained its intensity as it tracked northeastward toward the Wabash River, noting about a quarter-mile wide swath of heavy tree damage to distant tree lines as it continued toward the river. The tornado then crossed the Wabash River into the National Weather Service Indianapolis County Warning Area (CWA) in western Sullivan County at 9:21pm CDT. This was the rotating supercell's first tornado, having traversed through Illinois for nearly 28 miles, producing EF3 damage before entering Indiana. The tornado crossed the Wabash River, entering Sullivan County 1.8 miles south of Merom. Near Merom, the tornado severely damaged 3 homes and destroyed a modular home which was thrown at least 200 yards to destruction. Two occupants of this home were killed. Also, a large trailer and several cars were thrown tens of yards from their resting location. The violent winds sheared off trees approximately 20 to 30 feet above ground.\nThe tornado continued across southern portions of the City of Sullivan. Dozens of homes and structures were severely damaged or destroyed, indicating the strongest winds of the tornado's entire 41-mile track that peaked near 165 mph. The tornado continued to locations immediately south-southeast, and then southeast of Sullivan, destroying at least 3 additional homes, including a modular home which was thrown at least 150 yards. One occupant of this home was killed, while the other was injured. Many trees were again sheared 20 to 30 feet off the ground. Continuing to the east-northeast, the circulation began to weaken as it continued into a wooded area, damaging numerous trees before lifting off the ground 3.3 miles east of Sullivan. Much damage in the area reached EF2-intensity (111-135 mph winds), with several locations where winds reached the EF3-intensity (136-165 mph winds).", "f_scale": 3, "wind": 165, "source": "NWS Storm Survey", "state_1": "IL", "state_2": "IN", "state_3": null, "spc_id": null, "ncei_id": "1088281, 1088285, 1089561", "tornado_type": "Tornado", "storm_morphology": "Supercell", "satellite_scar": "True" }, "geometry": { "type": "LineString", "coordinates": [ [ -88.060377706, 38.901791081 ], [ -87.910345663, 38.936516224 ], [ -87.820395101, 38.957610125 ], [ -87.76168691, 38.971224372 ], [ -87.730890860999978, 38.979204842 ], [ -87.699545492, 38.99124057 ], [ -87.666243185, 39.007249454 ], [ -87.648770891000026, 39.010783038 ], [ -87.63551005, 39.015318003 ], [ -87.614181124000027, 39.019986045999985 ], [ -87.57457601, 39.030589251 ], [ -87.572324662, 39.031022591 ], [ -87.529250538, 39.040216297 ], [ -87.514865306, 39.043416146 ], [ -87.487296483, 39.056134119 ], [ -87.466353795, 39.067277124 ], [ -87.442591578, 39.07689255 ], [ -87.409804255, 39.082968983 ], [ -87.397118481, 39.084607929 ], [ -87.369892985, 39.091096725 ], [ -87.363455683, 39.091982726 ], [ -87.34417811, 39.096958779 ] ] } },

The tornado touched down in the McCormick's Creek State Park Campground Loop B, where EF2-intensity winds produced extensive tree damage. About 400 yards east the tornado impacted many campers at Campground Loop A, where two campers were killed and two others were injured. About 1.25 miles to the east-northeast further EF2-intensity damage occurred at Concord Road where large sections of a home's roof were removed while cars where crushed, rolled and thrown; here along the circulation's southern side the roof was blown off of a mobile home as it slid off its block piers, yet remained upright, consistent with high-end EF1 intensity winds.\nThe tornado intensified to EF3 strength as it neared the Owen-Monroe County line, with two barns 300-500 feet west of North County Line Road completely gone as their debris was lofted a quarter mile into Monroe County; a new farm combine weighing about 12 tons and other tractor implements were lofted and thrown 50 yards; debarking of trees also began near County Line Road, with only stubs of largest branches remaining, from the tornado's strongest winds of 153 mph. Less intense damage was again observed south of the path's center near the county line where unanchored outbuildings were destroyed by collapsed walls; and single-family homes experienced minor loss of roofing and broken glass, consistent with EF1-intense winds. The tornado maintained EF3 intensity while crossing into Monroe County. Continuation from Owen County of the rotating supercell thunderstorm's second EF3. The tornado reached peak intensity while crossing the Owen-Monroe County line, where the strongest winds in Monroe County were 152 mph along West Wolf Mountain Road. Here, 0.2 to 0.3 miles east of North County Line Road, the tornado destroyed both a mobile home and single story homes with little anchoring on cinder blocks, among many damaged and debarked trees. Back closer to North County Line Road, and slightly farther north of the center of the tornado's path, winds had separated a trailer home from its attached structure and garage, allowing the home to roll and flatten. Farther east along West Wolf Mountain Road, EF2-intensity damage was observed 0.50 to 0.75 miles east of the county line, with areas where nearly all trees were uprooted or snapped, and several single-family homes lost large sections of roofing; a few debarked trees were observed, but with less frequency than seen closer to the county line.\nThe tornado continued for another 2.7 miles while gradually weakening through EF2 and EF1 intensities. At North Texas Ridge Road hardwood trees were snapped off while a few homes lost small portions of roofing. At the intersection of West Brighton Road and North Fulton Road a narrower corridor of smaller trees were snapped or uprooted, including one tree downed onto a house; the tornado track ended about 250 feet northeast of this intersection.", "f_scale": 3, "wind": 140, "source": "NWS Storm Survey", "state_1": "IN", "state_2": null, "state_3": null, "spc_id": null, "ncei_id": "1089564, 1089811", "tornado_type": "Tornado", "storm_morphology": "Supercell", "satellite_scar": "True" }, "geometry": { "type": "LineString", "coordinates": [ [ -86.732994352, 39.297890562 ], [ -86.72012515, 39.301236615 ], [ -86.715408365, 39.302154386 ], [ -86.711062204, 39.302365713 ], [ -86.700902381, 39.303839216 ], [ -86.693888721, 39.306084049 ], [ -86.686760872, 39.308416029 ], [ -86.684052852, 39.309431218 ], [ -86.680787386, 39.310517925 ], [ -86.675879428, 39.311574427 ], [ -86.670694472, 39.312090598 ], [ -86.646920872, 39.316400341 ], [ -86.623009225, 39.323505174 ] ] } },

The tornado moved through mainly northern portions of the Park Forest neighborhood while strengthening from EF1 to EF2 intensity. The circulation continued towards US Highway 31, damaging a communications tower near Whiteland Sewer Department. After crossing US Highway 31, the tornado inflicted mainly EF2-intensity damage to southeastern portions of Whiteland, especially east of West Street and south of Main Street. Multiple homes sustained major roof damage, while a few homes had most exterior walls collapse, and one poorly constructed home had only one wall left standing.\nHigher-end EF2 damage was observed as it crossed the railroad track and hit the neighborhood near Paris Lane and East Pearl Street. Numerous homes sustained roof damage. A poorly constructed and very poorly anchored home along East Pearl Street was completely destroyed down to its concrete slab. The tornado produced damage to a home along Whiteland Road before crossing an open field as it departed the Whiteland community. The vortex maintained intensity before hitting a few more homes along County Road 225 East (Graham Road). Many trees were uprooted or snapped with significant roof damage and a collapsed garage. A warehouse further east-northeast along Graham Road sustained EF3 damage from winds of 140 mph. Portions of the warehouse were completely gone and blown onto I-65.

The tornado then moved into McNairy County. Peak winds in Hardeman County from this tornado were estimated at 105 mph. This tornado crossed from Hardeman County into McNairy County and moved east-northeast along Skipper Creek, intensifying as it moved into the Rose Creek area. A swath of significant damage was surveyed along Rose Creek Road from Talley Road to King Road. Tree damage was widespread and several homes were severely damaged. A single-wide manufactured home was destroyed on Rose Creek Road, killing all four occupants. Maximum wind speeds in this area were estimated at 125 mph. The tornado briefly weakened as it approaches Highway 64 west of Selmer. Widespread tree damage and sporadic damage to structures were noted along Bud Long Road, Highway 64, and John Moore Road, with several utility poles snapped along Highway 64. A church was damaged at Highway 45 and Dowty Road. The glass in the foyer was blown out and some damage to the siding was observed. Just north of the church, a metal building was destroyed and several utility poles were snapped. More significant damage was noted along Main Street just south of Hopkins Street in the Bethel Springs area. Several homes sustained significant damage. This is the same area affected by a tornado a few hours prior with a few of these properties sustaining damage from both tornadoes. The tornado continued to the east-northeast, damaging trees and utility poles on Murray School Road and numerous homes along Bethel Purdy Road. The Community Center on Purdy Beauty Hill Road was completely destroyed and a nearby home suffered severe damage. The tornado intensified as it followed Old Stage Road. Widespread damage to trees, powerlines, and homes was observed from Dogwood Lane to Leapwood Enville Road. Several homes were completely destroyed and four fatalities occurred in this area. Additional home and tree damage was observed along Puron and Neely Sharp Roads with another area of more significant damage near Highway 22 and Winding Ridge Road where another fatality occurred. The tornado weakened as it moved into Hardin County. Peak winds in McNairy County from this tornado were estimated at 155 mph. This tornado weakened as it moved from McNairy into Hardin County, with damage to homes and trees along Highway 69, Old Union Road, Harris Road, and Glendale Road near Hookers Bend. One area of more intense damage was surveyed near Chalk Bluff along Glendale Road where a manufactured home was completely destroyed and an area of trees was slightly debarked. The tornado then approached New Harmony, crossing the bends in the Tennessee River three times. Numerous homes were damaged along Emerald Lane and in the area of Flat Bluff near Becky Road and Lion Lane. Additional damage was noted in the Crossroads area along Clifton and Hardin Creek Roads as the tornado moved into Wayne County. Peak winds in Hardin County from this tornado were estimated at 145 mph. This major, long track tornado began in National Weather Service Memphis's area as an EF3 tornado in Hardeman, McNairy, and Hardin counties before entering Wayne County as an EF2 tornado. The tornado entered National Weather Service Nashville's area about two miles south of Clifton and continued northeast, passing across Highway 641 near Tom Holt Road where several homes and outbuildings were heavily damaged and dozens of trees blown down. Further northeast, the tornado struck the Leatherwood community along Beech Creek Road where a few poorly constructed homes were leveled and others heavily damaged. One person was critically injured in this area and airlifted to the hospital, and another person was also injured. The tornado then crossed Highway 13 about six miles north of Waynesboro before moving through the Topsy and Ashland communities, snapping and uprooting hundred of more trees. This tornado then continued into Lewis County. Damages are estimated for Wayne County. This narrative continues and concludes a long track tornado that began in NWS Memphis's area before entering Wayne County in NWS Nashville's area.

A tornado tracked out of Madison County, Alabama into Lincoln County after crossing Borderline Road. The tornado's estimated peak wind of 160 mph was noted at the intersection of Borderline Road and Myers Road where a newly constructed, however not completed, home was destroyed with a complete collapse of walls. The degree of damage at this location was slightly lowered below expected values due an uncertainty in the status of the garage, which was facing west. The tornado paralleled Borderline Road as it continued east-northeast. Sporadic trees were uprooted and snapped south of Vanntown, crossing Hester Creek. The tornado with a peak wind speed of 143 mph destroyed several farm outbuildings housing farm equipment from Mason Road eastward onto Echols Road. The tornado was weakening at this point, and finally lifted just after it crossed John Hunter Highway (Highway 122) just south of Elora in far southeastern Lincoln County.

The tornado crossed I-95 just north of exit 138 and produced widespread tree damage on both sides of I-95 and in the median. As it moved into the municipality of Dortches the first instances of EF-2 damage was observed as it entered into a neighborhood comprised of single-wide units. Multiple single-wide homes were completely destroyed and removed 20-30 yards from their foundation. As the tornado continued along its east-northeast path, a row of 10-15 power poles were snapped and laid out across South Browntown Road, continuing the path of EF-2 damage. Farther to the northeast, the tornado ripped across North Carolina Highway 48 where more power poles were snapped at the base and a residence building suffered major damage as all exterior walls had collapsed with only interior walls and a brick fireplace remained standing. The tornado then progressed into the Belmont Lake Golf Club where it strengthened into an EF-3 tornado with winds of 140-150 mph. The tornado flattened a metal truss tower connected to the electrical transmission line as well as caused significant damage to a metal warehouse building. Additionally, semi-trucks were flipped and destroyed that where located in a large parking lot near the warehouse. The tornado then weakened slightly as it crossed into Edgecombe County causing damage to a metal structure before lifting 9 miles east-northeast of Battleboro, NC.", "f_scale": 3, "wind": 150, "source": "NWS Storm Survey", "state_1": "NC", "state_2": null, "state_3": null, "spc_id": null, "ncei_id": "1128943, 1128944", "tornado_type": "Tornado", "storm_morphology": "Supercell", "satellite_scar": null }, "geometry": { "type": "LineString", "coordinates": [ [ -77.87755617, 36.002014809 ], [ -77.862879121999981, 36.005625435000013 ], [ -77.788034762, 36.023953756000026 ], [ -77.749410952, 36.036864332 ], [ -77.714392030999988, 36.047829719 ], [ -77.647272433000012, 36.061291459000017 ], [ -77.596289004000027, 36.069409023999981 ] ] } },

Initial damage from the tornado occurred in the Town of Lewis to the west of West Leyden along Mud Lake Road that included uprooted and snapped hardwood trees, significant damage to two homes that included roof uplift and near total removal, a wall blowout of a garage, and the complete destruction and shift from the foundation of a barn. Damage in the initial portion of the track generally peaked at EF-2. The tornado then continued northward and crossed Fish Creek Road with damage to another home that removed the roof and caused significant damage in the walls of the second level of the home. It also did significant damage to a second barn and snapped many hardwood trees.\nAfter moving north of Fish Creek Road, the tornado crossed a large swamp with evidence of full defoliation of a few hardwood trees in the swamp. Tornadic damage become less continuous north of this point without good road access to the track through swampy land. Convergent track damage again resumed well southwest of the Town of Turin, hitting the town water tower. The tornado then continued northward as it paralleled West Road. Continuous uprooting, snapping, and occasional defoliation of hard and softwood trees was evident for a long portion of the track until it reached Snow Ridge Ski Resort. Upon reaching Snow Ridge Ski Resort, tree damage increased to snapping of hardwood trees at the rootline and some defoliation. On the ski resort land, all of the chair lift metal cables failed, some chair lift structures were overturned or damaged, and the track of damage greatly widened as the storm continued north- northeastward. The greatest damage along the entire track of the tornado was from Snow Ridge Ski Resort to the West Wind Motel in Turin. Several structures saw completed roof failures, interior wall failures, window failures, and a one multi-story building was shifted from its foundation with its entire roof removed.

It quickly intensified as crossed Walnut Grove Road and destroyed a building next to a church. The tornado then continued northeast and damaged dozens of homes in a neighborhood along Garrettsburg Road near Purple Heart Highway. The tornado then went through a heavily wooded neighborhood south of Britton Springs Road where dozens of mobile and manufactured homes were destroyed. The tornado crossed into another neighborhood causing heavy damage in and near Eva Drive, with several houses shifted off their foundations that were only attached with straight nails (EF2/120mph). The tornado intensified to EF-3 (140 mph) as it crossed Highway 41 and struck several commercial businesses, including a vacant fast food restaurant and strip mall where only the interior remained. Just east of Highway 41 north of Ringgold Road, another neighborhood was struck with several homes sustaining significant damage. As the tornado continued northeast, it strengthened further to EF-3 (150mph), destroying four two story brick and vinyl siding homes on Henry Place Blvd. Debris was blown across the field towards West Creek Elementary School where the school sustained roof damage. As the tornado crossed Peachers Mill Road, two dozen brand new two story brick apartment homes were severely damaged with roofs missing on at least a dozen of these structures. Dozens more houses suffered significant roof damage along and near Needmore Road and Tiny Town Rd (EF-2). The tornado then crossed I-24 at Trenton Road where numerous cedar trees were uprooted. Continuing across Tylertown Road, the tornado caused EF-1 to EF-2 damage roof and siding damage to dozens of homes across 3 neighborhoods before moving into Kentucky. A total of nearly 1000 homes were impacted by the tornado, including 114 homes destroyed and 268 homes with major damage, with 3 people killed and 62 injured. Hundreds of trees snapped or uprooted. At least a dozen outbuildings destroyed, including barns, sheds and garages. Many homes suffered minor damages to roofs, siding, and gutters. Several homes had parts of roofs removed. Several broken power poles. The National Weather Service in Louisville conducted a storm damage assessment survey in Logan County, Kentucky from the storms Saturday afternoon. The survey was conducted in very cold conditions with temperatures in the mid to upper 30s with storm damage over 18 miles. The tornado continued eastward from Todd County, Kentucky dropping debris from Allensville into farmers fields between the county line and Gossett Hines Rd. The tornado sucked up leftover corn and beans from the fields, throwing them in all directions and covering portions of the roadway. It also knocked some powerlines down in this area with wind speeds estimated at 95 mph (EF1) and a path width of 125 yards. The tornado continued east northeastward, topping some trees near the intersection of Paul Young Rd as well as doing significant structural roof damage to a barn. Wind speeds were estimated at 90 mph (EF1), with a path width of 100 yards. The tornado increased in width and intensity as it approached Lickskillet. A series of small funnels inside the tornado increased to 250 yards wide, with wind speeds estimated at 115 mph (EF2) in a small area off of Lickskillet Rd. A well-built two-story house sustained extensive roof damage, had its foundation shifted, windows blown out, 3 vehicles thrown and severely damaged, and 2 barns destroyed with impalement of barn boards. Debris was thrown several hundred yards from the north to the east southeasterly direction. NWS drone clearly showed a large forested area had trees snapped, uprooted, twisted and facing numerous directions. The drone also showed debris deposited up to 500 yards to the east northeast. Several barns and outbuildings were destroyed along Lickskillet Road, with barn metal sheeting wrapped around trees and insulation on the front and back sides of homes. The survey team once again observed leftover corn and beans from harvested crops thrown all over the place. Wind speeds in this area ranged from 95 to 105 mph (EF1) with a damage width of 250 yards. Witnesses testimony and video clearly showed several small funnels mainly rain wrapped in this area. Numerous people heard the strong wind and roar and felt a severe pressure drop in their eardrums. The tornado next hit a couple of homes on Watermelon Rd (Hwy 1041). Significant roof damage occurred, including major loss of shingles, loss of gutters and large sections of the roof ripped off and mangled. There were several uprooted trees, and 2 outbuildings were destroyed. Some damage was thrown 400 yards to the east northeast. Wind speeds in this area ranged from 95 to 105 mph (EF1) with a width of 250 yards. The next concentrated damage area was near the intersection of Johnson Young Rd (Hwy 739) and McIntosh Rd. Several greenhouses had their roofing material ripped apart and bent, and two outbuildings and one barn were destroyed. Several witnesses had video of the tornado, which showed several small funnels. This was extremely helpful to determine why some areas had almost no damage, while other areas had substantial damage. Dozens of large trees were uprooted and snapped on the west side of McIntosh Road behind the greenhouses. Wind speeds in this area were between 100 and 105 mph (EF1) with a width of 250 yards. The tornado significantly damaged roofing structures of two homes on Orndorf Mill Road (Hwy 96). One middle section of the home on the west side of Hwy 96 was completely destroyed, and the home on the east side of Hwy 96 had most of its roof ripped off. There were some structural flaws to these homes and pine trees next to the home were not significantly affected. Thus, wind speeds were kept at 95 mph (EF1). Two barns were destroyed at this location as well. Along Nashville Road (Hwy 431), there was some metal uplift of some barns and one outbuilding, while no foundation support was destroyed. Wind speeds were between 80 and 85 mph (EF0) with a width of 175 yards. Along Franklin Road (Hwy 100), there were several power poles snapped or knocked down, and some shingle, gutter, and soffit damage to one home. Wind speeds were 90 mph (EF1) with a width of 175 yards. Along Dennis Corinth Rd (Hwy 2369), there was a partial uplift of an old barn. The debris from the barn was thrown to the north and east directions. The eastern debris struck a single-family residence, doing roof, gutter, and broken glass damage.
