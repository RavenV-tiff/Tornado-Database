The tornado crossed U.S. Highway 82 and strengthened as a manufactured home was rolled along Autauga County Road 40. Over the next two miles, the tornado further strengthened as it approached the Old Kingston community, where EF-3 damage began along County Road 43. At this location, at least three manufactured homes were obliterated with their frames thrown up to 100 yards. A pickup truck was sent airborne and landed 120 yards to the northeast, where a shallow crater was formed by its impact. The tornado became deadly as it impacted several homes along Sandy Ridge Road. The frame of a manufactured home at the western end of the road was thrown 250 yards to the north-northeast and came to rest in a field. Just downstream, several manufactured homes in a cluster were shredded and thrown considerable distances. Trees were snapped off relatively close to the ground and partially debarked. In total, five fatalities occurred along Sandy Ridge Road at three separate residences. Similar damage continued to the northeast along County Road 140, where a total of two fatalities occurred in two separate residences at the eastern end of the road. At least five manufactured homes were blown away with their frames thrown considerable distances. Several vehicles were picked up and thrown, and one pickup truck had its cab separated from the bed. From this area to the northeast to County Rd 42, the tornado caused massive tree damage and what appeared to be stands of debarked trees along Autauga Creek. In the three mile stretch of most severe damage from County Road 43 to County Road 42, wind speeds reached at least 150 mph. Based on the damage scene and contextual evidence, it is plausible that winds were stronger. However, with only manufactured homes in the path, there appear to be no damage indicators that will allow a higher rating. The tornado moved across County Road 57 at a slightly weaker state, where numerous trees were snapped and uprooted with several homes sustaining significant roof damage with one site-built home also sustaining partial wall failure.", "F_scale": 3, "Wind": 150, "Source": null, "State_1": "AL", "State_2": null, "State_3": null, "SPC_id": null, "NCEI_id": null, "Tornado_type": "Tornado", "Storm_morphology": "Supercell" }, "geometry": { "type": "LineString", "coordinates": [ [ -86.731196149, 32.52123293 ], [ -86.709624686, 32.529051299 ], [ -86.686192908, 32.536830251 ], [ -86.67456285, 32.542474092 ], [ -86.66516439, 32.547755827 ], [ -86.656023421, 32.55278404 ], [ -86.646453299, 32.55853539 ], [ -86.63965772, 32.562728554 ], [ -86.624948485, 32.572171601 ], [ -86.621621205, 32.574138071 ], [ -86.618062875, 32.576141665 ], [ -86.61443219, 32.578527443 ], [ -86.612631676, 32.57921529 ], [ -86.61090219, 32.579583047 ], [ -86.610271333, 32.580848721 ], [ -86.608202391, 32.581651651 ], [ -86.607150965, 32.581995185 ], [ -86.606317536, 32.582266126 ], [ -86.605980651, 32.582500722 ], [ -86.605487661, 32.583251064 ], [ -86.603942172, 32.583500122 ], [ -86.603217976, 32.58371347 ], [ -86.602625208, 32.584035752 ], [ -86.601545307, 32.585266363 ], [ -86.600898874, 32.586166399 ], [ -86.599190167, 32.586771977 ], [ -86.597010069, 32.58754217 ], [ -86.596293009, 32.588368039 ], [ -86.591400083, 32.590486171 ], [ -86.590541153, 32.591965559 ], [ -86.590039044, 32.593534776 ], [ -86.587957649, 32.59394425 ], [ -86.58668199, 32.594310335 ], [ -86.585968523, 32.594829178 ], [ -86.585825956, 32.5956777 ], [ -86.584341086, 32.596126031 ], [ -86.582934258, 32.596683701 ], [ -86.578513975, 32.598863851 ], [ -86.572896358, 32.60201286 ], [ -86.564519285, 32.608686515 ], [ -86.560699338, 32.611410857 ], [ -86.556403965, 32.613939104 ], [ -86.55180776, 32.617418979 ], [ -86.550825232, 32.618209723 ], [ -86.549806845, 32.618739017 ], [ -86.54722839, 32.620703063 ], [ -86.546548003, 32.621345401 ], [ -86.545720181, 32.622299383 ], [ -86.54435136, 32.623549394 ], [ -86.542039296, 32.625001191 ], [ -86.540108987, 32.625910637 ], [ -86.535326621, 32.628572603 ], [ -86.533679745, 32.630344326 ], [ -86.529854021, 32.632415684 ], [ -86.528690836, 32.633707717 ], [ -86.526144385, 32.634587209 ], [ -86.524796847, 32.636480933 ], [ -86.518846235, 32.639773849 ], [ -86.513573906, 32.643171516 ], [ -86.50621018, 32.647673765 ], [ -86.500539265, 32.651555591 ], [ -86.497138224, 32.653764966 ], [ -86.492950401, 32.655543717 ], [ -86.490546079, 32.658224527 ], [ -86.485454521, 32.66046502 ], [ -86.478319845, 32.66312202 ], [ -86.472033641, 32.666623419 ], [ -86.467833302, 32.668479436 ], [ -86.458409808, 32.67191289 ], [ -86.452623389, 32.674212824 ], [ -86.445131085, 32.67782592 ], [ -86.431145153, 32.683573759 ], [ -86.416230283, 32.68950558 ], [ -86.395089111, 32.697443656 ], [ -86.389923177, 32.698882215 ], [ -86.385983906, 32.700090528 ], [ -86.371187052, 32.706796888 ], [ -86.367440901, 32.707534151 ], [ -86.363722465, 32.709135043 ], [ -86.356510005, 32.710639615 ], [ -86.352441094, 32.711459596 ], [ -86.350929222, 32.711822943 ], [ -86.335057697, 32.718320059 ], [ -86.328831396, 32.721003921 ], [ -86.325752221, 32.722239012 ], [ -86.31817945, 32.725477848 ], [ -86.308325908, 32.729123465 ], [ -86.30188503, 32.731354988 ], [ -86.292919299, 32.735468907 ], [ -86.284642897, 32.739037408 ], [ -86.275182746, 32.743381837 ], [ -86.269743226, 32.746222861 ], [ -86.26680263, 32.747463618 ], [ -86.263860247, 32.748824671 ], [ -86.248397312, 32.75624167 ], [ -86.24110528, 32.759620621 ], [ -86.233516416, 32.763086657 ], [ -86.230312071, 32.765028631 ], [ -86.227721057, 32.765878184 ], [ -86.222380779, 32.768146376 ], [ -86.217075369, 32.770068693 ], [ -86.213840627, 32.771745143 ], [ -86.186804125, 32.781752633 ], [ -86.156278463, 32.793395141 ], [ -86.13662324, 32.802745517 ], [ -86.114410254, 32.811027285 ], [ -86.044795709, 32.834017119 ], [ -86.019167681, 32.841443275 ], [ -85.984573053, 32.852870064 ], [ -85.959216766, 32.862529679 ], [ -85.941449814, 32.870063351 ], [ -85.928618126, 32.875650112 ], [ -85.899961871, 32.886669637 ], [ -85.887327593, 32.891174272 ], [ -85.874072723, 32.892300173 ], [ -85.858966522, 32.896876589 ], [ -85.827696577, 32.904620394 ], [ -85.816051178, 32.908370641 ], [ -85.803176575, 32.912946227 ], [ -85.779229812, 32.920547662 ], [ -85.769359283, 32.923897851 ], [ -85.758923724, 32.926637779 ], [ -85.743278357, 32.92983025 ], [ -85.729420439, 32.932604612 ], [ -85.705637286, 32.938636753 ], [ -85.682131009, 32.946173808 ], [ -85.641409648, 32.954760915 ], [ -85.60521538, 32.972054071 ], [ -85.563360067, 32.981943658 ], [ -85.548356864, 32.984895548 ], [ -85.533387989, 32.988552868 ], [ -85.515951464, 32.992789498 ], [ -85.455181214, 33.006904677 ] ] } },
