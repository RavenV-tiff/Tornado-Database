While much of the damage along the track was rated EF0, the tornado did briefly intensify to EF1 strength near Meriwether Road and Hollis Drive. Here multiple homes suffered roof damage and a garage was destroyed, and one home suffered significant roof damage. A couple trucks were also moved and possibly rolled. The tornado weakened as it crossed Taylor Road, downing baseball fences and scoreboards at Buddy Watson Park.

It traveled in generally a northeasterly direction across Spot Ataway Road and Wesson Road, snapping and uprooting numerous hardwood and softwood trees. The most significant structural damage was observed as the tornado crossed Emma Drive west of Parkers Chapel Road. Here, two double-wide manufactured homes were partially shifted off their cinder blocks but remained intact with no other damage. Two outbuildings were also destroyed. One outbuilding was small and entirely made of wood, but its 2x4 vertical support boards were driven 3 feet into the ground during construction and mostly remained in place. The other outbuilding was much larger and consisted of a metal roof and frame, which was twisted to a great degree. The expected wind speeds for these two outbuildings and their Degree of Damage are in the low-end EF2 range. However, given the all-wood construction of the first building and its support beams remaining partially buried, and a distinct lack of widespread tree damage in the immediate vicinity, the estimated wind speeds were lowered, resulting in an EF1 rating, which was also more consistent with the vast majority of the damage observed. The tornado continued northeast across Parkers Chapel Road and through a couple of neighborhoods south and east of Parkers Chapel School. Widespread snapping and uprooting of large softwood pine trees occurred in this area. Structural damage in this area was caused by the falling trees instead of the tornado itself. One uprooted tree fell through a single-wide manufactured home occupied by three people when the tornado struck. No injuries occurred. Most residents the survey team spoke with said they received the warning before the tornado hit, including through Wireless Emergency Alerts. More snapped and uprooted softwood trees were observed as the tornado crossed Lynn Drive, Evans Drive, Ables Drive, Rilla Street, Oleta Avenue, Wotapi Street, and LA Hwy 15. The tornado began to weaken as it continued northeast but snapped another softwood tree north of Buchanan Road east of LA Hwy 15 and finally lifted near LA Hwy 15/US Hwy 82 on the southwest side of El Dorado.
