The most significant structural damage was observed as the tornado crossed Emma Drive west of Parkers Chapel Road.

The other outbuilding was much larger and consisted of a metal roof and frame, which was twisted to a great degree. The expected wind speeds for these two outbuildings and their degree of damage were in the low EF-2 range. However, given the all-wood construction of the first building and its support beams remaining partially buried, and a distinct lack of widespread tree damage in the immediate vicinity, the estimated wind speeds were lowered, resulting in an EF-1 rating, which was also more consistent with the vast majority of the damage observed.\nThe tornado continued northeast across Parkers Chapel Road and through a couple of neighborhoods south and east of Parkers Chapel School.

As it approached Bear Creek, it continued to cause sparse but notable tree damage. The most significant damage along the entire path occurred along Alabama Highway 13 south of Bear Creek, where a large metal building structure received significant damage to the windward side of the building. Winds in this area approached 110 mph, bringing this tornado to a high end EF1 rating. The tornado then crossed AL Hwy 13, where an individual received major injuries as the manufactured home being occupied was flipped upside-down. The tornado continued eastward, crossing Old Union Road, then paralleling County Line Church Road until the tornado passed into Winston County just north of Sherwood Place Drive. National Weather Service meteorologists surveyed damage in northern Marion County and determined that it was consistent with an EF1 tornado, with maximum winds near 110 mph. The tornado began on Marion County Road 348 west of Alabama Highway 253 south of Hackleburg, where minor tree damage was noted. The tornado rapidly increased and caused significant damage as it crossed Alabama Highway 253, uprooting several trees and causing superficial damage to a home on the edge of the track. The tornado continued east-northeastward along Union Hill Road, crossing the road twice before the intersection with Chalk Mine Road. Damage in this segment of the path consisted solely of pockets of tree damage which varied in intensity but was easily identified as tornado damage. As the tornado paralleled Chalk Mine Road, it produced more widespread tree damage, and destroyed a manufactured home. The damage to trees surrounding the manufactured home was minimal, which contributed to a below expected value or 100 mph assigned to the flipping and tossing of the manufactured home.

The tornado continued near Five Mile Lane and River Road in Floyd County along the Ohio River where shingles were lost on a residence and a barn garage received significant roof damage where the metal panels were peeled off. The tornado then crossed the Ohio River into Kentucky in the Lake Dreamland area of West Louisville in western Jefferson County. Significant tree damage was observed along River Front Drive and continued along Kale Dreamland Road where several hardwood trees were snapped or uprooted, along with many large branches down. The tornado continued along Kramers Lane toward Van Winkle Drive, where damage appeared to be sparser with large branches down in some isolated areas. Very isolated areas of large branches down continued through the Heatherfield and St. Dennis neighborhoods (and across I-264 Watterson Expressway) and toward the Louisville Memorial Gardens. Along Lynn Lea Road, the tornado regained strength and continued through homes along Kendall Lane west of 31W Dixie Highway. Trees were snapped heading on the east side of Hunters Trace neighborhood.

It was here that the first notable damage occurred. A farm building had its entire roof removed which was reinforced with hurricane straps. This would likely have required around 100mph wind gusts to accomplish. The roofing material was quickly wrapped around the tornadic circulation and thrown back into the trees behind the building. In addition to this, inflow winds rapidly strengthened with a tree stand to the southwest having multiple trees snapped and uprooted facing towards the northeast, resulting in the tornadic circulation being approximately 230 yards here. A garage attached to the home just east of the farm building had 50% of its roofing material removed and likewise thrown towards the back. A small outbuilding at this location was destroyed with debris thrown across the field. The tornado continued across the field into an area of forest where drone footage revealed multiple snaps and uproots along a narrow corridor around 100 yards wide. Based on Digital Globe Worldview satellite imagery the details of what happened for the rest of the tornado path have become clearer. The tornado turned to the south where it crossed a small pond to the southwest of a home uprooting a tree facing north. Sporadic uproots are visible on satellite imagery to the west of a large field within the forest, generally consisting of high end EF0 wind speeds. The tornado continued to the south-southeast through the forest, eventually intensifying notably west of Magnolia Springs Highway where numerous uproots are noted. This is where the tornado likely peaked in intensity with at least 100mph winds. The tornado may have continued southeast from here, but cloud cover in the area prevented visibility of the damage path in this area.

There it dropped numerous trees on to the NJ Transit Line and snapped the trunked of around 10 trees. As it moved to north east, the storm uprooted two maple trees along Mine Brook behind the Rose Bowl Baseball/Softball field that were on a slight embankment. The storm continued to move towards the northeast into Bernardsville where it produced trees damage along Laurel Lane and snapped the trunk of a tree that appeared not to be fully healthy. The tornado then started to move more towards the north following Mine Brook through Bernardsville producing damage from Timber Rock Trail to Anderson Hill Rd where it snapped the trunk of a pine tree that ended up falling on a vehicle. The peak width of the tornado was over this area where the damage path was approximately 475 yards between the damage from Timber Rock Trail to Anderson Hill Rd. Additional damage was found along the path of Anderson Hill Rd moving to the north towards the intersection of Anderson Hill Rd and Seney Dr where numerous trees were brought down with at least two ended up on power lines. At the intersection of Anderson Hill Rd and Rolling Hill Rd another large tree had its trunk snapped however the interior of the tree was not determined to be healthy so the expected winds based on the DoD were reduced significantly. As the storm was starting to occlude and weaken it uprooted took down several more trees along Old Fort Road including uprooting multiple trees with wide but shallow root systems. The tornado then dissipatted as the storm moved further to the northeast. The EF-1 rating is primarily based on the number of trees with snapped trunks with the highest concentration in a single location being along the NJ transit line. This is where the DI of hardwood trees with DoD of trunks snapped produced an expected wind speed of 105 mph.
