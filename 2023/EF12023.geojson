The other outbuilding was much larger and consisted of a metal roof and frame, which was twisted to a great degree. The expected wind speeds for these two outbuildings and their degree of damage were in the low EF-2 range.

A portion of the tornado was aloft, based on the lack of tree damage initially, until it hit a plastic surgery center off of Bush Farm Road which sustained roof damage. This consisted of shingle and fascia damage. Most of that was cleaned up and repaired by the time of the survey. There was insulation on the backside of the three-story building.\nThe street sign was bent back and turned to the northeast at Arnold Palmer Boulevard near Chestnut Ridge. There was sporadic tree damage along Chestnut Ridge Circle, and at 15107 Chestnut Ridge Circle a doorbell camera showed an intense loud 20 second burst of wind and rain. The homeowner stated that the entire house was shaking, and several trees were snapped and twisted, and their garbage tote was found two houses over behind that house. Behind their house across Lake Forest Country Club were several uprooted and twisted trees. Most of the trees were laying from the north northeast to due east. There was sporadic wind damage along Champion Lakes Way, with several houses sustaining gutter and fascia damage. The maximum wind speed in Lake Forest was 85 mph with a width of 75 yards.\nThe tornado took a southward jog along Flat Rock Road and increased in wind speed and width. All along Flat Rock Road there were dozens and dozens of trees snapped, twisted and uprooted. The width of the tornado increased to 130 yards wide and the wind speed increased to 90 mph.

The severe thunderstorm formed as a result of a multi-cell cluster of thunderstorms that formed ahead of a cold front passage late Saturday afternoon. As the cell moved east of Rising Sun, it began to show signs of rotation.\nThe tornado touched down in Plumpton Park Zoo, downing a few dozen trees. It then proceeded to near the village of Calvert, just east of Chandlee Road and its intersection with Telegraph Road/MD-273 where three wooden power poles were snapped. The tornado continued to move east along Telegraph Road and caused uprooted and snapped hardwood and softwood trees near Rosebank United Methodist Church. The tornado then moved to the southeast and resulted in extensive tree and minor structural damage in the vicinity of Calvert Regional Park, Cecil Arena, and Rising Sun High School. Over 100 trees were damaged in this area with numerous softwood and hardwood trees being uprooted and snapped. The area was littered with small tree debris. Damage to fencing was observed along with shingles being removed, soffit, fascia, and siding damaged, and other minor structural damage to homes and businesses. At the Calvert Regional Park, portable toilets were broken into several smaller parts and moved more than 300 yards into fields to the north of the storm's track. Also, off North East Road, a wooden power pole was snapped along with several trees downed and a sign blown off the Cecil Arena. The tornado moved further east toward Dr. Miller Road where a small barn collapsed and was moved approximately 50 yards into a field as a result. Additional softwood and hardwood trees were uprooted and snapped along Blue Ball Road with two sheds being moved approximately 100 yards into a field. As the tornado moved to the northeast and began to occlude, additional hardwood and softwood trees were uprooted and snapped between Blue Ball Road and Telegraph Road.\nThe Federal Aviation Administration's Terminal Doppler Weather Radar in Pennsauken Township, NJ depicted a tight velocity couplet that corresponded to the path of the damage described above.\nAdditional scattered tree damage in northern Cecil County, MD was determined to be caused by straight-line winds.", "f_scale": 1, "wind": 90, "source": "NWS Storm Survey", "state_1": "MD", "state_2": null, "state_3": null, "spc_id": null, "ncei_id": "1080800", "tornado_type": "Tornado", "storm_morphology": "QLCS", "satellite_scar": "False" }, "geometry": { "type": "LineString", "coordinates": [ [ -76.005714798999975, 39.702781585000025 ], [ -75.912909779000017, 39.680622412 ] ] } },

This rather atypical tornadic movement was represented quite closely in the associated radar data. Many trees were uprooted and a few were snapped as the tornado crossed Highway 154 and the team was not able to survey more damage from the ground due to lack of road access until the tornado next crossed Highway 4 near the intersection of Highway 4 and PR 537. The tornado also uprooted numerous hardwood and softwood trees here, while also snapping a few softwoods. It is possible that the tornado continued a bit farther than the endpoint represented in the survey, but the NWS survey team could not confirm this due to the lack of ground access immediately to the southeast.

The supercell spawned a quick spin-up tornado that struck the town of Laguna Heights, Texas, over a two-minute period before the circulation moved over Laguna Madre Bay and rapidly dissipated. The tornado tracked to the east-northeast after the circulation was impacted by the approaching squall line, creating a boomerang effect since the original motion of the radar couplet was to the north-northwest prior to touchdown. Winds may have reached 110 mph, the top of the EF1 scale, in a few locations ��� but the very poor quality of construction suggests 105 mph is a better estimate.\nThe strongest portion of the tornado, rated EF1, flattened at least six poorly built mobile home structures, removed part of the second story of a local business, and removed the majority of roof decking on at least ten other residences and buildings. At least a half dozen ash and mesquite trees were snapped or uprooted and two wooden power poles were bent. Casualties were found in several of the demolished mobile homes. A man in his forties was killed when the home collapsed on him. Five others were injured in the same cluster of damaged homes, and two more were injured in a flattened mobile home near the shoreline of Laguna Madre Bay. Two of the injuries, in the home along the bayfront, required extended hospitalizations. Thirty-eight additional residents were displaced by the tornado and were housed at the local events center with American Red Cross assistance. In all, there was the one fatality and eleven injuries, of which two were critical head injuries. Surrounding the EF1 area, portions of roofs and shingles were removed from residences, large limbs were broken, and fences were knocked down. An NWS Storm Survey conducted for the Laguna Heights survey found tornado damage to the immediate coast at 4:08AM CDT. Therefore, it is reasonable to infer that it continued into the Laguna Madre for at least a short period of time as the supercell got ingested into the squall line.", "f_scale": 1, "wind": 110, "source": "NWS Storm Survey", "state_1": "TX", "state_2": null, "state_3": null, "spc_id": null, "ncei_id": "1087621, 1087624", "tornado_type": "Tornado", "storm_morphology": "Supercell", "satellite_scar": null }, "geometry": { "type": "LineString", "coordinates": [ [ -97.262770577961177, 26.079919439791365 ], [ -97.26174890699815, 26.080443368504174 ], [ -97.259678242104314, 26.081214276542422 ], [ -97.258905765616987, 26.081378095048247 ], [ -97.257907984047094, 26.081366045974168 ], [ -97.257350083873504, 26.081525046515484 ], [ -97.256406921353786, 26.082168427221749 ], [ -97.2395, 26.0889 ] ] } },

This tornado started in the vicinity of New State Road and Townline Road 131, downing a deteriorating barn. As the tornado continued south toward the village of North Fairfield, the tornado increased in intensity, lifting a large portion of a roof off an outbuilding and downing several trees on Hanville Corners Road. A power pole was separated from power lines with additional tree damage. The tornado entered North Fairfield causing widespread tree and power line damage throughout the village. Some roofing material was lifted off residences and some trees fell onto homes. A large sign was ripped off the facade of a building and several light and power poles were leaning along Main Street/State Route 162. Damage in the village reflected an EF-0 to EF-1 tornado but was the widest swath of damage in the path of this tornado. The tornado continued southeast across Penn Road toward Old State Road and Olive Road, where a large area of snapped and shredded trees fell and additional damage occurred to several barns and outbuildings. The maximum intensity of damage occurred near the intersection of Old State Road and Townline Road 12. Several large trees were snapped and a mobile home was heavily damaged. Just east of this intersection, three power poles were snapped at the base. As the storm continued southeast toward Boughtonville Road, several silos were heavily damaged. In the vicinity of Edwards Road and Boughtonville Road, several roofs were displaced off outbuildings and the second floor of a residence was heavily damaged. The tornado continued toward Greenwich Milan Townline Road, where a large path of trees were snapped. The tornado began to cycle down west of the Village of Greenwich, where some minor tree damage and a leaning power pole was noted off US Route 224 and Greenwich Milan Townline Road.

There it dropped numerous trees onto the NJ Transit Line and snapped the trunk of around ten trees. As it moved to the northeast, the storm uprooted two maple trees along Mine Brook behind the Rose Bowl Baseball field that were on a slight embankment. The storm continued to move towards the northeast into Bernardsville where it produced tree damage along Laurel Lane and snapped the trunk of a tree that appeared not to be fully healthy. The tornado then started to move more towards the north following Mine Brook through Bernardsville producing damage from Timber Rock Trail to Anderson Hill Rd where it snapped the trunk of a pine tree that ended up falling on a vehicle. The peak width of the tornado was over this area where the damage path was approximately Four hundred seventy five yards between the damage from Timber Rock Trail to Anderson Hill Rd. Additional damage was found along the path of Anderson Hill Rd moving to the north towards the intersection of Seney Dr and Anderson Hill Rd where numerous trees were brought down with at least two ending up on power lines. At the intersection of Anderson Hill Rd and Rolling Hill Rd, another large tree had its trunk snapped. However, the interior of the tree was determined not to be healthy, so the expected winds based on the DoD were reduced significantly. As the storm was starting to occlude and weaken, it took down several more trees along Old Fort Road including uprooting multiple trees with wide, but shallow root systems. The tornado then dissipated as the storm moved further to the northeast. The EF-1 rating is primarily based on the number of trees with snapped trunks with the highest concentration in a single location being along the NJ transit line. This is where the damage indicator of hardwood trees with degree of damage of trunks snapped produced an expected wind speed of one hundred five mph.", "f_scale": 1, "wind": 105, "source": "NWS Storm Survey", "state_1": "NJ", "state_2": null, "state_3": null, "spc_id": null, "ncei_id": "1113664", "tornado_type": "Tornado", "storm_morphology": "Supercell", "satellite_scar": null }, "geometry": { "type": "LineString", "coordinates": [ [ -74.58038453, 40.710917694999978 ], [ -74.578667915999972, 40.712739365 ], [ -74.575148857999977, 40.716447609999989 ], [ -74.573518074999981, 40.718919659 ], [ -74.571114815999977, 40.722692608999978 ], [ -74.570084846999976, 40.725619750000021 ], [ -74.568883218, 40.728611806 ] ] } },

A single family house and detached garage near the intersection of North Bayberry Parkway and DE Route 896 sustained some cosmetic damage. Additionally, several trees sustained varying degrees of damage on and immediately surrounding this property. No additional straight line winds were found beyond this property. The tornadic circulation began about 200 yards northwest of the aforementioned property where several small to medium sized softwood trees were damaged or uprooted, falling in a convergent pattern, along North Bayberry Parkway. The tornado continued northeast where it caused some minor damage to a small park playground and pavilion. The tornado moved northeast through a field and across a pond, then impacted one home along Plato Place. This home sustained some cosmetic damage and a fence was blown down. The tornado then continued into a tree line where some trees were uprooted, then emerging into a residential area along Milford Drive. This is where the tornadic circulation reached its maximum width of about 200 yards. Additional trees were uprooted or snapped along the western loop of Milford Drive and a few homes sustained some minor cosmetic damage. The tornado continued northeast toward the western loop of Milford Drive where it strengthened. A tree line of cedar trees had most trees uprooted. One homes detached garage had a garage door blown inward and an exterior wall pushed outward, but not completely collapsed. The home itself had several singles and shutters blown off. Another home had a back deck porch roof completely blown off and destroyed. A hot tub was blown off of its supports and flipped over and much of the patio furniture was blown dozens of yards away. Another detached garage at another residence sustained some minor cosmetic damage as well. The tornado continued along Ethel Court where primarily tree damage occurred, including another row of cedar trees that were blown down. The tornado continued northeast along Bullen Drive, turning slightly left as the circulation began to occlude. Numerous small trees sustained varying degrees of damage just north of the Asbury Loop intersection. Several residences along Bullen Drive were impacted from near the intersections of South Red Fox Circle and North Red Fox Circle, particularly on the eastern side where the most significant damage was noted. Numerous trees were snapped or uprooted in this area. One home had a large chimney blown off, landing in the backyard. Another home had a large section of attic wall blown off along with roofing material blown off. The most significant damage from the tornado occurred to a home where the entire attached garage roof was blown off into the front yard. This home also had an upstairs window blown out and the northeast facing upstairs exterior wall was pushed outward, but not completely collapsed. The home northeast had nearly an entire side of the house stripped of siding. A home across the street had a portion of its porch roof lifted and another had 3 windows blown out along with other cosmetic damage. The tornado then moved north-northeast crossing Angelo Court where two homes sustained minor cosmetic damage and had a few small trees uprooted. The tornado then dissipated as it reached Hyatts Corner Road. No known injuries or fatalities occurred from this tornado. The survey team found additional wind damage farther northeast of where the tornadic circulation dissipated. A semi-truck was blown over on DE Route 1 southbound just downstream. Some corn was blown down in a field east of US Route 13, but there was no supporting evidence of a tornadic circulation in this area. Additional sporadic tree damage and some minor cosmetic damage to homes was found in residential areas along and off of Port Penn Road, including along Sugar Pine Drive and Dutch Neck Road.

There was also damage to brickwork on buildings, presumably as this roof was dragged across the top of adjacent buildings. This is where the estimated peak wind speeds of 110 MPH occurred. The tornado then continued southeast, snapping several trees across the southeast half of town. An old garage was also swept off of its foundation and blown into a nearby home and garage, causing significant damage to those buildings. Finally the tornado passed onto the golf course on the southeast edge of town. A maintenance building was severely damaged and several healthy trees were snapped. From here, the tornado passed into a corn field, producing a small path of crop damage. The tornado appeared to have lifted less than one-half mile southeast of Sutton.", "f_scale": 1, "wind": 110, "source": "NWS Storm Survey", "state_1": "NE", "state_2": null, "state_3": null, "spc_id": null, "ncei_id": "1117235", "tornado_type": "Tornado", "storm_morphology": "QLCS", "satellite_scar": null }, "geometry": { "type": "LineString", "coordinates": [ [ -97.871146, 40.616298 ], [ -97.865731821, 40.612535305999984 ], [ -97.860818014000017, 40.609020832 ], [ -97.85845767, 40.606707613000026 ], [ -97.854895696000028, 40.603416838999976 ], [ -97.849402532, 40.599637136000013 ], [ -97.845783, 40.597727 ], [ -97.840676, 40.594273 ], [ -97.836986, 40.591894 ], [ -97.833831, 40.590199 ], [ -97.831342, 40.588944 ], [ -97.829196, 40.588505 ], [ -97.826922, 40.587445 ], [ -97.821493, 40.584724 ], [ -97.814627, 40.581432 ], [ -97.810249, 40.579444 ], [ -97.8054, 40.577293 ] ] } },

The first damage point had a few topped and twisted trees near County Rd 200 West and Haysville Rd. Wind speeds were 85 mph with a width of 60 yards. At County Road 150 W. and Haysville Rd they were tree snapped and twisted and a cinder block building collapsed. Winds increased to EF1 90 mph with a width of 75 yards. Further east along Haysville Road, all the way to Haysville US 231, there were trees twisted, topped, snapped and uprooted. There was a baseball park home plate fencing that came apart and was thrown 25 yards and moved 20 degrees to the north. Wind speeds were consistent at 90 mph with a width of 90 yards.\nOn Indiana 56 in Haysville there were several barns, outbuildings and one business with substantial roof and gutter damage. Winds were between 90 and 95 mph with a width of 100 yards. Along Indiana 56 there was a lot of tree damage with snapped and uprooted trees facing from a north northeast direction to a east southeast direction. At 1011 West Haysville Rd. there was a greenhouse that was thrown 60 yards and moved 30 degrees to the north, and two barns sustained roof damage.\nAt East County Road 725 North there was a single residence home that lost its entire roof, and debris from that house was on three sides of the adjacent house with some windows blowing out. The homeowner described the harrowing experience of holding down his family as the roof started breaking away. He described an intense earache and a loud noise that lasted 15 seconds. Four barns experienced extensive roof and siding damage. Wind speeds in this area were 100 mph, with a width of 100 yards. Drone photography showed damage from the barns went up to 200 yards to the east and northerly directions.\nSadly there were several barns damaged at a turkey farm on N. Hickory Grove Rd with many poultry killed. Further east on N. County Rd. 575 W. there were a couple of large barns that had extensive roofing damage that was thrown a couple hundred yards to the east northeast. Max Wind speeds were 100 mph and the width was 125 yards. Tornado damage continued along both sides of Indiana 56 with trees and barns taking the most damage. There were at least 10 barns that had significant roofing damage between Kellerville and Crystal. In the Crystal community along East Cuzco Rd North, there were many trees that were snapped. Homes in this area had shingles removed, soffits, facia, and gutter damage, and one garage sustained significant roofing and siding damage. Winds in this area were 95 mph with a width of 125 yards.\nA few single family homes, as well as smaller farm outbuildings, sustained considerable wind damage (95mph) just north of State Road 56 on N Crystal Road. A freestanding garage had its roof uplifted and blown towards the east side of the property. The southern wall of the garage was also missing. The adjacent home had evidence of mud splatter on its southern and eastern wall. Trees in the vicinity of the home were snapped in a converging pattern. Drone imagery from the patch of forest just to the east of the home indicates tree convergence in an easterly direction for an area about 150 yards wide. Most of the trees in this area were snapped and uprooted with very few still standing. The path of destruction appears to weaken east of this point.\nMultiple homes along East Old State Rd 56 experienced significant wind damage from various directions. Most homes saw the loss of roof covering and had mud splatter on the southern and western walls. Debris appeared to cover large distances as well with some debris being found a quarter of a mile to the east. The most eastern house on the road saw the most damage where the eastern side of the house (garage portion) was completely separated from the main home and shifted from its foundation. The front of the garage which was faced to the NW, seemed to have twisted and rolled towards the southeast. The roof and structure of the garage totally collapsed. Trees in the vicinity are tilted towards the south while some fell towards the east. The debris hit the western wall and some mud splatter was observed on the western and southern wall.\nThe tornado continued to the east where it crossed into Orange County. The tornado first touched down in Dubois County near County Rd 200 West and Haysville Rd. After crossing into Orange County, the tornado continued about a mile and a half east where drone footage as well as tree snapping and uprooting indicated a slight convergence pattern towards the northeast. Multiple vehicles, trailers, and mobile homes were rolled over into the forest towards the northeast. This area along South County Road 1050 W sustained significant and extensive damage as compared to areas just west. The tornado continued to track in the east-northeast direction. Drone footage from trees and cornfields also indicate convergence. Most of the worst damage was observed just north of the French Lick airport.\nAs the tornado tracked northeastward, large swaths of trees were snapped and uprooted. Some homes saw minor roof and wall paneling damage. Areas just east of W County Road 150 S saw extensive tree damage where a path of about 200 yards wide experienced 105 mph winds according to the damage observed in the forest.\nJust southwest of Paoli, near S county Road 225 and heading northeast towards S Thompson Lane, a path of significant damage affected multiple homes and created a vast debris field toward the northeast. The entire western side of a home had sidewall and paneling ripped off part of the roof. Part of the actual roof was also ripped off. Tree next to it also snapped. There was lots of debris to the northeast and house insulation in the fences and trees. A barn located on the edge of a clearing near a cornfield was mostly flattened towards the northeast.\nThompson lane saw major tree damage with large swaths of trees being snapped in a northeast direction and some slight convergence seen from drone footage. The tornado ended here with no observed damage to the east from this tornado track on the southwest side of Paoli. In total, the tornado was rated EF1 with 107 mph maximum winds and was a continuous track for 25.89 miles, which is a record long tornado for August in the NWS Louisville county warning area.

However, a large office complex on the north side of Wildwood Parkway sustained substantial damage. A large number of windows were blown out of a 5-story professional building with many windows and debris blown back westward. A large load bearing beam was also pulled from the roof structure. The tornado is estimated to reach its maximum intensity here at EF-1 / 100 mph. The tornado continued to move northeast, felling large stands of trees as it crossed Interstate 65. The tornado reached its maximum width of approximately 600 yards as it crossed Green Spring Avenue. Significant structural damage was noted to an auto repair shop with the roof blown off. Several additional businesses and an apartment complex in this area also sustained minor roof damage. Power poles were also snapped in this area. Further northeast, the tornado tracked through a densely populated residential area. Here the primary damage was caused by snapping and felling of trees. Many large and mature trees fell through homes in this area causing moderate to severe damage. The most concentrated area of damage was along Saulter Road and surrounding streets. It is estimated that over three dozen homes in this area sustained at least moderate damage from falling trees. The tornado began to weaken as it tracked on the north side of the Samford University campus with a few trees down in this area.
