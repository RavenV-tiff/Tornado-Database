On Walker Road, the tornado caused roof damage to a chicken house and some manufactured homes. The most significant damage on Walker Road occurred just north of its intersection with Whitman Road where a single-wide manufactured home, which was anchored into the soil, was flipped and rolled off its foundation destroying most of the roof and walls, but leaving the undercarriage attached. The tornado snapped and uprooted more trees and broke a wooden electrical pole as it crossed Rome Road, LA Hwy 4, and Strain Allen Road. On Strain Allen Road, a very large hardwood tree was snapped and a home suffered the partial loss of its metal roof. More broken tree limbs and snapped trunks were observed as the tornado crossed Halfway Creek Road and travelled north-northeast along Kelley Road. The most significant damage along the entire track occurred as the tornado cross LA Hwy 811/Gladway Road near its intersection with Kelley Road. Here, a brick single-family home lost most of its roof. This caused the partial failure of the walls of the garage of the home, but the majority of the walls of the home remained standing and intact. This damage was rated as EF2. A metal garage building on this property suffered complete loss of its walls, but most of its roof and the metal frame poles remained standing. About 150 yards to the northwest, another brick single-family home suffered almost total loss of its roof covering. The damage in this area was rated as EF2 based mainly on the roof lose to the two homes. On the north side of Gladeway Road, a double-wide manufactured home suffered the loss of most of its roof, but the walls remained standing. An attached car port on another brick single-family residence was destroyed as the tornado continued north of Gladway Road and west of Kelley Road. This tornado continued to snapped numerous trees on Kelley Road as it continued northward crossing Slash Pine Road and again crossing Kelley Road, then, Parish Barn Road. More tree damage was observed along Lucy-Leonard Road and LA Hwy 155. Two brick single-family homes on LA-155 just west of Sugar Creek Road suffered some loss of shingles from the roof. The tornado began to weaken rapidly and caused more minor roof damage to a single-family home and snapped some large tree branches along Stonewall Road before finally lifting. Three minor injuries were reported from this tornado, but their exact locations were not available to the survey team. The team spoke was almost a half dozen residents that were at home in the path of the tornado.

There the tornado intensified to its maximum intensity of EF-2 with estimated peak winds of 120 mph. Along US 82 near 9th Street, a small guest home on concrete blocks was pushed off its foundation and destroyed. A nearby mobile home was rolled across three parked cars which were also destroyed. Several sheds and outbuildings were destroyed in the immediate vicinity as well. Widespread damage was common in the western part of town where many homes suffered minor to moderate roof damage. Several trees were uprooted or snapped along with continued minor to moderate residential damage as the tornado moved northeast and across northern Montrose. It crossed US 165 north of Montrose where an outbuilding was destroyed. As the tornado moved into farmland northeast of town, a center pivot irrigation system was destroyed. It continued northeast into Chicot County and across the intersection of Arkansas Highways 144 and 293 where a home and several buildings lost roofing and paneling, and some power poles were blown down. The tornado crossed US Highway 65 and Cedar Road near the Bellaire community in northern Chicot County, blew down a few power poles and damaged a few trees, and then dissipated shortly after crossing into Desha County.", "F_scale": 2, "Wind": 120, "Source": null, "State_1": "AR", "State_2": null, "State_3": null, "SPC_id": null, "NCEI_id": null, "Tornado_type": "Tornado", "Storm_morphology": "QLCS" }, "geometry": { "type": "LineString", "coordinates": [ [ -91.769733191, 33.041565406 ], [ -91.741593462, 33.066312778 ], [ -91.654930226, 33.168910489 ], [ -91.635301722, 33.184381411 ], [ -91.587826885, 33.20733848 ], [ -91.517409205, 33.27520303 ], [ -91.50549657, 33.295141776 ], [ -91.504085728, 33.298432875 ], [ -91.492938467, 33.312044327 ], [ -91.468781576, 33.345561399 ], [ -91.414193279, 33.388370355 ], [ -91.359330286, 33.453618482 ], [ -91.327357401, 33.526145653 ], [ -91.325089353, 33.530531772 ], [ -91.324975409, 33.534191053 ] ] } },

The tornado began in a wooded area near the Autauga/Elmore County line, with snapped tree tops observed west of Highway 143. It continued northeastward and began to intensify as it reached Coosa River Road and Foreman Road, where multiple trees were uprooted, a barn was damaged, and minor shingle damage occurred to residences. It continued to down trees, damage outbuildings, and remove shingles from homes as it crossed Highway 111 near Chase Drive and Toad Road. More trees were downed along Shady Nook Drive before it began to cross the Shoal Creek inlet of Lake Jordan. It remained over the lake for a little while but downed trees near the Lightwood Road bridge, some of which fell on residences. The tornado reached its maximum intensity as it reached the northeast side of Lake Jordan. Multiple residences on Circle Drive suffered roof damage with much of the roof removed from one residence. Many trees were snapped and some boathouses were destroyed. The tornado continued to move along the northeast shore of the lake downing trees, some of which fell on residences, and causing roof damage. Dozens of residences suffered varying levels of damage, but many people received warnings from multiple sources and took shelter. The tornado left the lake, downing some trees along Joe s Fish Camp Road. The tornado became progressively weaker while continuing to down a few trees, eventually dissipating northeast of Titus Road prior to reaching Highway 231", "F_scale": 2, "Wind": 120, "Source": null, "State_1": "AL", "State_2": null, "State_3": null, "SPC_id": null, "NCEI_id": null, "Tornado_type": "Tornado", "Storm_morphology": "Supercell" }, "geometry": { "type": "LineString", "coordinates": [ [ -86.409792254, 32.623922708 ], [ -86.353487322, 32.644739506 ], [ -86.326442074, 32.655424303 ], [ -86.31052048, 32.663412676 ], [ -86.291414569, 32.665392498 ], [ -86.280029127, 32.667859987 ], [ -86.269665071, 32.673715937 ], [ -86.267828295, 32.674655165 ] ] } },

The tornado continued to move into the northern portions of Eutaw where it snapped and uprooted numerous trees along with minor roof damage to several homes. Trees also fell on at least 2 homes causing significant damage to the homes. A rooftop observation deck was taken off of one home and thrown across the street off of Ashby Drive. The tornado continued east-northeast before ending just east of Highway 11 snapping and uprooting several trees along the way. Additional survey work was completed today, northeast of Eutaw. It was determined the tornado continued northeast after crossing US Hwy 11 in Greene County, moving into the Oak Village area of Hale County near Lock 8 Boat Land on the Black Warrior River. Tree damage could be seen on both sides of the river from Lock 8. Most significant damage was on the Hale County side along Flemming Rd and Oak Village Road. Many mobile homes were destroyed on Flemming Rd, mostly due to tree fall. Tree fall consisted of hardwood trees being snapped or uprooted. One home in Oak village sustained significant damage after garage failure occurred. This resulted in adjacent walls collapsing and most of the roof structure being blown north into the river. Additional timber and varying degrees of structural damage was observed to the end of Oak Village Rd. This survey was somewhat difficult as this exact spot was damaged by an EF1 tornado just 6 weeks ago. The tornado continued northeast, but is believed to have weakened or skipped along its path. Only minor timber damage was found near Stewart and up to Hwy 69. However, more significant timber damage was found on County Rd 50, entering the Talladega National Forest. Hardwood trees were snapped and uprooted with a path width around 300 yards at this point. The tornado then continued over the EF3 path from March 25th, 2021 before crossing into Tuscaloosa County where high-end timber damage was observed. The path hear was nearly 600 yards wide with the center portion consisting of most trees snapped at their base, a section 200 yards wide or so. The rating here was assigned 130 mph, high-end EF2. The tornado continued northeast crossing US Hwy 82 near Hagler causing additional timber damage and some minor structural damage to at least two homes. It is believed the tornado weakened and dissipated thereafter, generally north of US Hwy 82 in western Bibb County. This area was not accessible.

The tornado began just east of Orrville near the intersection of Hwy 22 and Cahaba Rd. As it moved northeast, it intensified as the damage path was nearly parallel with Hwy 22. The damage consisted of mainly uprooted trees with trunks that were snapped. There were also several manufactured homes that sustained roof and some foundation damage. As the tornado continued down Hwy 22, additional tree damage was observed as it neared the southwestern sections of Selma. The tornado quickly intensified as it entered the city limits of Selma, nearly parallel to Hwy 22/W Dallas Ave. the main damage indicators used were the uprooted hardwood trees and the snapped softwood trees. Most of the softwood trees were snapped about halfway up on the trunks. The daycare on W Dallas Ave and Cooper Dr sustained heavy exterior wall damage and was consistent with the higher-end EF2 wind speeds. Some debris rowing was also noted in the downstream vicinity. The second area of higher-end EF2 damage was noted downstream at the Selma Country Club where buildings had significant roof and exterior wall damage and there was a complete blow down of extremely large hardwood trees. Additional softwood trees were also snapped in and around adjacent streets. As the tornado continued further north and east, it entered the northern sections of downtown Selma. Nearly all of the damage continued to consist of mainly trees, with hard and softwood trees uprooted. The homes that sustained damage were observed to have roof material missing or fallen trees that impacted the structure. Very little damage observed to homes was directly wind related likely due to the sheltering nature of the very large and older trees that were embedded within the historic neighborhoods. However, the tree fall damage remained consistent with high-end EF-1 or low end EF-2. As the tornado exited downtown, it crossed Hwy 14, east of Selma, crossing Parkway Dr. Additional structure damage was noted with exterior walls the were collapsed consistent once again with higher EF-2 wind speeds.

The tornado was part of a larger mesocyclone which can be traced west all the way back to the Selma Alabama tornado which spawned numerous tornadoes during its lifecycle. This particular tornado first touched down in an area around Crouch road and Wild Plum Road snapping and uprooting trees. The tornado struck a Rinai building causing damage to the roof, windows and outside walls. The tornado continued northeast snapping and uprooting trees quickly intensifying as it crossed hwy 19 becoming and EF2. Widespread tree damage was noted along S. McDonough Road and Walnut Grove Road north of Hwy 16. A well built home sustained significant roof and structure damage consistent with high end EF2 winds. The tornado continued northeast crossing High Falls Road, N. Walkers Mill Road, Yamacraw road snapping and uprooting trees consistent with EF1 damage. As the tornado continued northeast, it became the dominant circulation within the larger mesocyclone as the previous Griffin tornado began to occlude within the large circulation. The tornado crossed Jackson road and paralleled Jenkinsburg road before crossing I75 near Jenkinsburg Road. Snapped and uprooted trees were noted along both sides of I75 where the tornado crossed. As the storm became the dominant circulation within the mesocyclone, the wind field expanded and the damage became fairly consistent with high end EF1 to low EF2 thereafter. The tornado crossed Locust Road, Dean Patrick Road and England Chapel Road were numerous trees were snapped and uprooted. Some home damage was noted in the area as well, particularly as it approached Shiloah Road. Several homes were damaged along Plaza Dr and Smith Dr. The tornado continued NE crossing Hwy 23 striking a large warehouse. Severe roof and exterior wall damage was noted as debris was spread across the highway and to the NE of the hwy. As the tornado crossed the highway it struck a train on the tracks and overturned 3 rail cars just west Walter Moore Rd. The storm continued northeast crossing Wolf Creek Road snapping and uprooting trees near several homes consistent with EF1 wind damage. The tornado continued northeast crossing Rising Star Church road and Brown road snapping and uprooting trees. As the storm continued northeast beyond this point, the remnant circulation which last produced damage near Locust Grove regenerated a new tornado a little over a mile to the northwest along Fincherville Road. The two tornadoes would continue to the NE nearly parallel through the Jackson Lake area. This particular tornado continued northeast and would intensify to EF2 as it crossed Hwy 36 north of Keys Ferry Road and Haley Road. The fatality and critical injury directly associated with this tornado occurred along Haley Road when a tree fell onto a vehicle injuring the driver and fatally wounding a passenger. EF2 damage was noted East of hwy36 along Haley Road, Pocahontas St. Chickasaw lane and several neiborhoods along the lake. The tornado crossed into Southern Newton County causing severe damage along Parker Road, Ray Road, Malcom Rd, Quarry Ct, Pebble Ridge Dr, Hunters Trace, Campbell Rd and Hwy 212 as it entered Jasper County near the Franks Restaurant. EF1 to low end EF2 damage was intermittent along Yancy Rd, Dallas Tr, Gem Lane, Lee s Cove, Alcovy N. Dr, Rainbow Dr and County Line Road. The Bear Creek Marian was destroyed and several campers were destroyed. The storm continued NE crossing Henderson Mill Road snapping and uprooting trees, County line Trail and Hwy 11 before weakening and lifting as it approached Margery Lake. A second fatality was resulted the following day when a lineman was knocked out of a bucket truck in Jasper County after being struck by a large tree branch while attempting to restore powerlines. The fatality, is considered indirect but will be tied to this particular tornado. Widespread wind damage can be seen via areal survey and ground survey throughout northern Butts, Southern Newton and Western Jasper counties and surveying this particular storm was a challenge to discern where the tornado actually ended and where the severe wind damage started.

One sturdy palm tree was snapped at the intersection of Red Bay and Loblolly with four others partially uprooted on Driftwood Point Road. The tornado then lifted over Choctawhatchee Bay. Most of the roof damage in this community was consistent with EF-1 winds. However, three homes experienced the uplift and failure of large sections of the roof structures themselves. That is consistent with EF-2 damage with maximum winds of 115 mph.", "F_scale": 2, "Wind": 115, "Source": null, "State_1": "FL", "State_2": null, "State_3": null, "SPC_id": null, "NCEI_id": null, "Tornado_type": "Tornado", "Storm_morphology": "QLCS" }, "geometry": { "type": "LineString", "coordinates": [ [ -86.318193503, 30.411620552 ], [ -86.316391059, 30.412157205 ], [ -86.313923427, 30.413267513 ], [ -86.310618945, 30.414211264 ], [ -86.306220122, 30.416080235 ] ] } },

Numerous damaged/fallen trees, some uprooted, had snapped and twisted trunks in a residential neighborhood along Kent Dr. Several of these trees fell on top of a few homes. The damages in that area were consistent with EF-1 intensity.
