On Walker Road, the tornado caused roof damage to a chicken house and some manufactured homes. The most significant damage on Walker Road occurred just north of its intersection with Whitman Road where a single-wide manufactured home, which was anchored into the ground, was flipped and rolled off of its foundation, destroying most of its roof and walls, but leaving the undercarriage attached. The tornado snapped and uprooted more trees and broke a wooden electrical pole as it crossed Rome Road, Highway 4, and Strain Allen Road. On Strain Allen Road, a very large hardwood tree was snapped and a home suffered the partial loss of its metal roof. More broken limbs and snapped trunks were observed as the tornado crossed Halfway Creek and travelled north-northeast along Kelley Road. The most significant damage along the entire tornado track occurred as it crossed Highway 811/Gladway Road near its intersection with Kelley Road. Here, a brick single-family home lost most of its roof. This caused the partial failure of the walls of the garage of the home, but the majority of the home remained standing and intact. A metal garage building on this property suffered a complete loss of its walls, but most of its roof and the metal frame poles remained standing. About 150 yards to the northwest, another brick single-family home suffered almost a total loss of its roof covering. The damage in this area was rated as EF-2 based mainly on the roof loss to the two homes. On the north side of Gladway Road, a double-wide manufactured home suffered the loss of most of its roof, but the walls remained standing. An attached carport on another single-family brick residence was destroyed as the tornado continued north of Gladway Road and west of Kelley Road. This tornado continued to snap numerous trees on Kelley Road as it continued northward crossing Slash Pine Road and again crossing Kelley Road and Parish Barn Road. More tree damage was observed along Lucy-Leonard Road and Highway 155. Two brick single-family homes on Highway 155 just west of Sugar Creek suffered some loss of shingles from the roof. The tornado began to weaken rapidly and caused more minor roof damage to a single-family home and snapped some large tree branches along Stonewall Road before finally lifting. Three minor injuries were reported from this tornado, but their exact locations were not available to the survey team.", "f_scale": 2, "wind": 120, "source": "NWS Storm Survey", "state_1": "LA", "state_2": null, "state_3": null, "spc_id": null, "ncei_id": "1064054", "tornado_type": "Tornado", "storm_morphology": "Supercell", "satellite_scar": "True" }, "geometry": { "type": "LineString", "coordinates": [ [ -92.704844258, 32.171951438 ], [ -92.65025594, 32.243993423 ], [ -92.633089803000018, 32.286668781 ], [ -92.634806416, 32.321200798 ], [ -92.595667623, 32.364564801 ] ] } },

The tornado continued on to the east-northeast, producing mostly tree damage as it crossed Cypress Road and Albert Barr Road. In addition, falling trees downed many power lines in this area as it moved to the northeast for two to three miles. The most significant damage occurred a little farther to the northeast as the tornado crossed Wheeler Road. At this location, there were a few collapsed electrical transmission towers which were rated as high-end EF-2 damage with estimated 130 mph winds. From here, the last few miles of the tornado tracked closer to the Haile community, crossing Highway 143, Jordan Taunton Road, Sunset Road, Haile Baptist Church Road, and Jessie Guinn Road. In these areas, the damage was again confined to mainly snapped and uprooted trees, with several homes and outbuildings heavily damaged, but mainly due to downed trees. The tornado was unique in a few ways. First, the path width was up to a half a mile in the latter portion of the track, which is very wide for a tornado which was mostly weak throughout a majority of its path. Secondly, the collapsing of the large electrical transmission towers garnered a rating up to 130 mph, but there were no other surveyed damage indicators which warranted an EF-2 rating. The survey team believes there could be other significant damage indicators near the downed transmission towers, although potentially live downed high voltage lines in the vicinity of the towers did not allow the survey team to survey in close proximity.", "f_scale": 2, "wind": 130, "source": "NWS Storm Survey", "state_1": "LA", "state_2": null, "state_3": null, "spc_id": null, "ncei_id": "1064234", "tornado_type": "Tornado", "storm_morphology": "QLCS", "satellite_scar": "True" }, "geometry": { "type": "LineString", "coordinates": [ [ -92.169518263999976, 32.783981187999984 ], [ -92.160935196, 32.796103142 ], [ -92.156472, 32.810531885 ], [ -92.148232254, 32.817024056 ], [ -92.136387619, 32.823804261 ], [ -92.125057968, 32.827122045 ] ] } },

As it moved northeast, the tornado uprooted, snapped, or damaged trees along its path. It crossed over several highways, county roads, and low-lying areas through the county until it reached Montrose near the intersection of US Highway 82 and 165. There the tornado intensified to its maximum intensity of EF-2 with estimated peak winds of 120 mph. Along US 82 near 9th Street, a small guest home on concrete blocks was pushed off its foundation and destroyed. A nearby mobile home was rolled across three parked cars which were also destroyed. Several sheds and outbuildings were destroyed in the immediate vicinity as well. Widespread damage was common in the western part of town where many homes suffered minor to moderate roof damage. Several trees were uprooted or snapped along with continued minor to moderate residential damage as the tornado moved northeast and across northern Montrose. It crossed US 165 north of Montrose where an outbuilding was destroyed. As the tornado moved into farmland northeast of town, a center pivot irrigation system was destroyed. It continued northeast into Chicot County and across the intersection of Arkansas Highways 144 and 293 where a home and several buildings lost roofing and paneling, and some power poles were blown down. The tornado crossed US Highway 65 and Cedar Road near the Bellaire community in northern Chicot County, blew down a few power poles and damaged a few trees, and then dissipated shortly after crossing into Desha County. This tornado crossed the Chicot/Desha County line around 7:44 PM CST, and did sparse damage along Arkansas Highway 35, knocking over a few telephone polls along the road. More conclusive evidence was noted in the cotton fields alongside the road, where swaths of convergent flow and damaged cotton were observed for around a half mile, between the county line and the town of Halley, with the tornado dissipating just before reaching Halley.

It tracked northeastward and began to intensify as it reached Coosa River Road and Foreman Road, where multiple hardwood trees were uprooted, a barn was damaged, and minor shingle damage occurred to residences. It continued to uproot trees, damage outbuildings, and remove shingles from homes as it crossed Highway 111 near Chase Drive and Toad Road. More hardwood trees were uprooted along Shady Nook Drive before it began to cross the Shoal Creek inlet of Jordan Lake. It remained over the lake for a little while and uprooted trees near the Lightwood Road bridge, some of which fell on residences. The tornado reached its maximum intensity as it reached the northeast side of Jordan Lake. Multiple residences on Circle Drive suffered roof damage with much of the roof removed from one residence. Many hardwood trees were snapped and some boathouses were destroyed. The tornado continued to move along the northeast shore of the lake uprooting trees, some of which fell on residences, and caused roof damage. Dozens of residences suffered varying levels of damage. The tornado exited the lake near Joe's Fish Camp Road, where several hardwood trees were uprooted.

This tornado began in the city of Eutaw just west of West End Avenue and moved across West End Avenue where it destroyed a shed, caused roof damage, and snapped and uprooted trees. The tornado continued to move into the northern portions of Eutaw where it snapped and uprooted numerous trees along with minor roof damage to several homes. Trees also fell on at least two homes causing significant damage to the homes. A rooftop observation deck was taken off of one home and thrown across the street off Ashby Drive. The tornado continued east-northeast and uprooted several trees along Highway 11. The tornado traveled over mostly marshy river bottom land before crossing the Black Warrior River and into Hale County. National Weather Service meteorologists surveyed damage in northwest Hale County and determined that it was consistent with an EF1 tornado, with maximum winds near 90 mph. This tornado originated in Greene County and crossed a winding Black Warrior River and in and out of Hale County several times. The tornado produced some uprooted and snapped trees along the river banks. National Weather Service meteorologists surveyed damage in southeast Greene County and determined that it was consistent with an EF1 tornado, with maximum winds near 90 mph. This tornado crossed a winding Black Warrior River several times before eventually moving into Hale County. Damage consisted of several uprooted and snapped trees along the river banks. National Weather Service meteorologists surveyed damage in northern Hale County and determined that it was consistent with an EF2 tornado, with maximum winds near 115 mph. This tornado originated in northeast Greene County and crossed into Hale County west of Akron along the Black Warrior River. The most significant damage was on the Hale County side of the river along Flemming Road and Oak Village Road. Many manufactured homes were destroyed on Flemming Road, mostly due to uprooted and snapped hardwood trees. One home on Oak Village Road sustained significant damage after garage failure occurred. This resulted in adjacent walls collapsing and most of the roof structure being blown north into the river. Additional timber and varying degrees of structural damage was observed to the end of Oak Village Road. The tornado continued northeast, but is believed to have weakened or skipped along its path. Only minor timber damage was found near the Stewart community and along Highway 69. However, more significant timber damage was found downstream on County Road 50, entering the Talladega National Forest. Hardwood trees were snapped and uprooted with a path width around 300 yards at this point as the tornado strengthened. The tornado continued northeast and crossed into the far southeast corner of Tuscaloosa County. National Weather Service meteorologists surveyed damage in the far southeast portion of Tuscaloosa County and determined that it was consistent with an EF3 tornado, with maximum winds near 130 mph. This tornado originated in Greene County, crossed through northern Hale County and entered Tuscaloosa County near the intersection of Hale, Bibb, and Tuscaloosa Counties. The tornado path widened to nearly 600 yards once it crossed into Tuscaloosa County and shortly reached its maximum intensity. The tornado was rated at 130 mph at this point due to a large swath of trees snapped at their bases. The tornado continued northeast crossing Highway 82 near Hagler, causing additional timber damage and some minor structural damage to two homes. The tornado weakened after crossing Highway 82 and into Bibb County. National Weather Service meteorologists surveyed damage in western Bibb County and determined that it was consistent with an EF0 tornado, with maximum winds near 75 mph. This tornado originated in Greene County, crossed through northern Hale County, southeast Tuscaloosa County, and into western Bibb County.

The overall length and damage width in the densely populated neighborhoods had devastating impacts to the city. Many hardwood trees were uprooted and softwood trees were snapped, many onto homes. Most of the softwood trees were snapped about halfway up on the trunks. A daycare center on West Dallas Avenue and Cooper Drive sustained heavy roof and exterior wall damage which was consistent with the higher-end EF2 wind speeds. Some debris rowing was also noted in the downstream vicinity. Over seventy children and workers survived without injury by taking shelter in small interior rooms and bathrooms after receiving the warning, while portions of the roof collapsed over large open classrooms and the former sanctuary. The second area of higher-end EF2 damage was noted downstream at the Selma Country Club where several buildings had significant roof and exterior wall damage and there was a complete blow down of extremely large hardwood trees. Additional softwood trees were also snapped in and around adjacent streets. As the tornado continued northeast, it entered the northern sections of downtown Selma. Much of the damage continued to consist of downed trees, some on homes, but several homes near the center of the track had entire roofs removed. Another notable area of damage was where Broad Street crossed the railroad tracks. A strip mall had much of its roof removed, and some of the X-braces in a metal building system failed, which from a structural engineering perspective was one of the more impressive damage indicators. Several older homes collapsed near the intersection of Minter Street and Saint Phillip Street, but they were built on brick pilings with open air underneath them, which kept them in the EF2 range. As the tornado exited downtown, it crossed Highway 14, where structure damage was noted with exterior walls that collapsed. The tornado caused some significant damage at the Dallas County Jail on Selfield Road, with significant loss of roof material. The tornado weakened as it approached the Brantley community, where a few trees were uprooted. The tornado lifted just east of River Road.", "f_scale": 2, "wind": 130, "source": "NWS Storm Survey", "state_1": "AL", "state_2": null, "state_3": null, "spc_id": null, "ncei_id": "1076636", "tornado_type": "Tornado", "storm_morphology": "Supercell", "satellite_scar": "True" }, "geometry": { "type": "LineString", "coordinates": [ [ -87.227783904, 32.317286156 ], [ -87.212679074, 32.32669307 ], [ -87.204589532, 32.329920509 ], [ -87.193667577, 32.333111573 ], [ -87.178325341, 32.340526734 ], [ -87.169677899, 32.345929085 ], [ -87.157854722, 32.353071296 ], [ -87.146610902, 32.361318579 ], [ -87.137448476, 32.367698379 ], [ -87.121441052, 32.378390783 ], [ -87.116779373, 32.380157626 ], [ -87.11214988, 32.382486182 ], [ -87.107922719, 32.38406721 ], [ -87.104162262, 32.38490981 ], [ -87.100423263, 32.386721826 ], [ -87.09266095, 32.388959615 ], [ -87.084726975, 32.392492854 ], [ -87.080923603, 32.394241303 ], [ -87.078246758, 32.39494792 ], [ -87.074041055, 32.397008856 ], [ -87.072029398, 32.398005336 ], [ -87.067542062, 32.399493241 ], [ -87.065507123, 32.400438391 ], [ -87.063119957, 32.400778088 ], [ -87.061399804, 32.401316287 ], [ -87.060053335, 32.401701273 ], [ -87.058002302, 32.402612431 ], [ -87.053929851, 32.404226291 ], [ -87.048426816, 32.406036439 ], [ -87.043094584, 32.408246576 ], [ -87.038212964, 32.410329853 ], [ -87.036332217, 32.411325401 ], [ -87.033746568, 32.412371538 ], [ -87.029076503, 32.414185267 ], [ -87.025120244, 32.415811026 ], [ -87.023424554, 32.416570459 ], [ -87.018414722, 32.417767332 ], [ -87.012478993, 32.419053398 ], [ -87.010411104, 32.419754266 ], [ -87.005840619, 32.420963324 ], [ -87.00343736, 32.421814636 ], [ -87.000747011, 32.423128841 ], [ -86.997021423, 32.425463081 ], [ -86.968099163, 32.43484924 ], [ -86.964172409, 32.436587814 ], [ -86.959891603, 32.437484253 ], [ -86.946909712, 32.442007058 ], [ -86.942521618, 32.443433121 ], [ -86.93567662, 32.444890851 ], [ -86.929695294, 32.446873688 ], [ -86.922834204, 32.448313254 ], [ -86.903421632, 32.452429387 ], [ -86.872093431, 32.457535356 ] ] } },

The survey team found evidence of snapped pine trees just southwest of Movico Loop Road North. The tornado strengthened as it crossed Movico Loop Road East causing significant softwood tree snaps and uprooting of large hardwood trees. A double wide manufactured home that was secured with straps rolled from its foundation and was destroyed just west of U.S. Highway 43. This is where the tornado reached peak intensity.

Damage quickly picked up just to the northeast approaching Whitesville Road (just north of I-85) where several one-story metal buildings had significant roof damage, along with their garage doors and windows blown in. Numerous trees in this area were either snapped or uprooted. Several power poles along Orchard Hill Road were broken off near the top. Maximum winds in this area were determined to be in the 90-100 mph range (EF-1). As the tornado continued northeast, a large warehouse building at the Vaughan Xpress transportation facility sustained significant damage. About 1/4 of the large warehouse was completely destroyed with several metal bolt anchors stretched or ripped up out of the concrete pad. Winds were estimated between 110-120 mph at this time and as it crossed I-85, a large number of trees were snapped (some near the base) or uprooted. Widespread significant damage by this strong tornado continued across the Baldwin Park community. In this location, more than 30 homes had significant damage; one and two-story homes lost major parts of the roof and upper level floors along with at least partial-collapse of exterior walls. Debris was thrown for hundreds of yards. Winds in this area likely maxed out around 120 mph, making this an EF-2 tornado. The tornado continued east-northeast, cutting down trees across Upper Big Springs Road, I-185, and Stewart Road (east of I-185).

The tornado initially traveled north then turned to a east-northeast direction crossing Wilbur Keith Rd and Piney Woods Rd downing hundreds of trees. The tornado broadened and intensified as it approached GA100 with a diameter of 0.9 miles and winds over 100 mph uprooting and snapping over 1000 trees. A home on Forrest Rd had its entire roof blown off where max winds were estimated at 120 mph and first reached EF-2 intensity. The tornado continued at 100 to 120 mph intensity as it continued east-northeast into neighborhoods south of Allie Rd along Mount Pilgram Rd where several homes were damaged or destroyed by trees falling on them. One double-wide manufactured home on Ground Hog Dr had its roof blown off and was shifted 20 yards off its foundation, breaking the home in half. The tornado continued east-northeast along Allie Rd crossing US27. Just east of US27 a very large stand of trees were snapped and a large recently-constructed two-story barn was destroyed. Just east of this location, two single-wide mobile home completely destroyed. The residents of one of the homes was at the hospital when the tornado struck and returned home early next morning to find it in shambles. Here, maximum winds were also rated at EF-2 intensity (120 mph). The tornado began to weaken east of this point and it tracked a bit more northeast in direction, crossing Rocky Mountain Rd and Malcom Rd before it traveled along Callaway Rd downing several hundred more trees as it moved near the Alps community. While the tornado remained weak east of this area, the overall storm remained extremely strong and the tornado did not dissipate, continuing east parallelling HWY 362 causing sporadic tree damage before crossing the Flint River into NW Pike County crossing River RD and lifting around the Kings Bridge Road. Here winds were only 75-80 mph downing several trees as far as could be seen from public roadways.

The tornadoes were part of a larger mesocyclone which can be traced west all the way back to the Selma Alabama tornado. This particular tornado was spinning up in extreme SW Spalding County near Holonville Road and the Flint River as the EF2 tornado crossing Meriweather County into NW Pike was weaking and winding down. The particular tornado first showed a debris signature on radar in a marshy area near the flint River east of Holonville Road. Areal satellite imagery and newly acquired information from a homeowner along Huff Creek Road confirm the track continued east just north of Huff Creek Road snapping and uprooting hundreds of trees. The tornado Crossed Hancock Road as a high end EF 1 before reaching Blanton Mill Road where several outbuildings were destroyed, a home was damaged and hundreds of trees were uprooted or snapped. As the tornado continued east toward Nunnally Road it was noted that the tornado which would become the Griffin Tornado had crossed approximately 2 minutes prior and as this tornado approached that area. Damage in the Nunnally Road area is consistent with multiple circulations crossing this region. Also as this EF1 tornado reached the Nunnally/Bethany Road area, a strong surge in wind can be seen on radar rotating ENE around the larger mesocyclone and catching this tornado in this region. The particular tornado would be not only becoming part of that wind surge but also merge with an EF1 tornado sinking ESE out of Spalding County approximately at the Spalding/Pike county line in and around the Yarborough Mill Road region. This tornado would become the dominate circulation per radar analysis thus this track is continued ENE. As the EF1 tornado merges from the WNW, this tornado increases to max intensity of EF2 in and around the Yarborough Mill Road and Crystal Creek Drive area where several structures were severely damaged or destroyed in addition to hundreds of trees snapped and uprooted. Per damage analysis from imagery, this merging which occurred likely resulted in the increased intensification of the tornado to EF2 in this region. The tornado continued eastward toward a large rock quarry along Rover Zetella Road. The tornado snapped trees up to the Rock Quarry however, it appears that due to the size of the quarry, the tornado redeveloped on the N side of the quarry along Rover Zetalla Road and continued east before resuming a northward path. Numerous trees were snapped or uprooted wet of Candler Road north across North Rover Road,Agape Avenue and Bethel Lane. Numerous homes sustained everything from minor to moderate damage in this area consistent with EF0 to EF1 winds. This particular tornado continued north toward the stronger EF3 tornado occurring simultaneously ultimately absorbing this tornado into the circulation in the area around Maloy road. Due to the scope of the damage and the width, the exact location and the damage attribution (which tornado caused which damage) becomes difficult to discern even with the imagery. As a result, the exact width is an estimate due to the challenges of determining where one tornado damage swath ended and where another one started. The one thing that can be certain is that the vorticies/tornadoes did merge near or just after the EF3 damage occurred.", "f_scale": 2, "wind": 130, "source": "NWS Storm Survey", "state_1": "GA", "state_2": null, "state_3": null, "spc_id": null, "ncei_id": "1079325, 1079328, 1079329", "tornado_type": "Tornado", "storm_morphology": "QLCS", "satellite_scar": "True" }, "geometry": { "type": "LineString", "coordinates": [ [ -84.484452487, 33.195857117 ], [ -84.479281188, 33.195839161 ], [ -84.464647056, 33.194833626 ], [ -84.460688116, 33.194398191 ], [ -84.458864213, 33.194092935 ], [ -84.456321479, 33.193329792 ], [ -84.453886034, 33.193370194 ], [ -84.452738048, 33.193370194 ], [ -84.451396944, 33.193307347 ], [ -84.449835898, 33.193145739 ], [ -84.446901561, 33.192651936 ], [ -84.445270778, 33.192584599 ], [ -84.441456677, 33.192562154 ], [ -84.432988943, 33.19447226 ], [ -84.428568663, 33.194481238 ], [ -84.423912348, 33.195010943 ], [ -84.418698133, 33.197623507 ], [ -84.411123575, 33.200514295 ], [ -84.406638922, 33.20133124 ], [ -84.400872172, 33.202296302 ], [ -84.398554744, 33.203508225 ], [ -84.39504105, 33.205088189 ], [ -84.392762847, 33.206635204 ], [ -84.391282268, 33.208026601 ], [ -84.389930434, 33.208870405 ], [ -84.388739534, 33.209525694 ], [ -84.386819072, 33.210360508 ], [ -84.384866424, 33.210988857 ], [ -84.382348837, 33.211659095 ], [ -84.377668671, 33.212157897 ], [ -84.375437073, 33.212391279 ], [ -84.37316256, 33.213019613 ], [ -84.372765593, 33.213638967 ], [ -84.372143321, 33.214563501 ], [ -84.371639066, 33.214949469 ], [ -84.371070437, 33.21519182 ], [ -84.370501809, 33.215936821 ], [ -84.370169215, 33.216870306 ], [ -84.369300179, 33.217094701 ], [ -84.368770443, 33.21711029 ], [ -84.368400298, 33.217101314 ], [ -84.367669396, 33.21720241 ], [ -84.366823159, 33.217137217 ], [ -84.365138443, 33.217133352 ], [ -84.363300589, 33.217282077 ], [ -84.362517384, 33.217614179 ], [ -84.361455229, 33.218807939 ], [ -84.360900552, 33.220041447 ], [ -84.35963455, 33.221603162 ], [ -84.358926447, 33.222509661 ], [ -84.358293445, 33.222850718 ], [ -84.357574613, 33.223299475 ], [ -84.35696307, 33.22371233 ], [ -84.356287153, 33.224044407 ], [ -84.355600507, 33.224421358 ], [ -84.354752929, 33.224950881 ], [ -84.350847633, 33.227409982 ], [ -84.346212776, 33.230210043 ], [ -84.34552613, 33.230874146 ], [ -84.343906076, 33.232561306 ], [ -84.342049987, 33.234499705 ] ] } },

The tornado was part of a larger mesocyclone which can be traced west all the way back to the Selma Alabama tornado which spawned numerous tornadoes during its lifecycle. This particular tornado first touched down in an area around Crouch road and Wild Plum Road snapping and uprooting trees. The tornado struck a Rinai building causing damage to the roof, windows and outside walls. The tornado continued northeast snapping and uprooting trees quickly intensifying as it crossed hwy 19 becoming and EF2. Widespread tree damage was noted along S. McDonough Road and Walnut Grove Road north of Hwy 16. A well built home sustained significant roof and structure damage consistent with high end EF2 winds. The tornado continued northeast crossing High Falls Road, N. Walkers Mill Road, Yamacraw road snapping and uprooting trees consistent with EF1 damage. As the tornado continued northeast, it became the dominant circulation within the larger mesocyclone as the previous Griffin tornado began to occlude within the large circulation. The tornado crossed Jackson road and paralleled Jenkinsburg road before crossing I75 near Jenkinsburg Road. Snapped and uprooted trees were noted along both sides of I75 where the tornado crossed. As the storm became the dominant circulation within the mesocyclone, the wind field expanded and the damage became fairly consistent with high end EF1 to low EF2 thereafter. The tornado crossed Locust Road, Dean Patrick Road and England Chapel Road were numerous trees were snapped and uprooted. Some home damage was noted in the area as well, particularly as it approached Shiloah Road. Several homes were damaged along Plaza Dr and Smith Dr. The tornado continued NE crossing Hwy 23 striking a large warehouse. Severe roof and exterior wall damage was noted as debris was spread across the highway and to the NE of the hwy. As the tornado crossed the highway it struck a train on the tracks and overturned 3 rail cars just west Walter Moore Rd. The storm continued northeast crossing Wolf Creek Road snapping and uprooting trees near several homes consistent with EF1 wind damage. The tornado continued northeast crossing Rising Star Church road and Brown road snapping and uprooting trees. As the storm continued northeast beyond this point, the remnant circulation which last produced damage near Locust Grove regenerated a new tornado a little over a mile to the northwest along Fincherville Road. The two tornadoes would continue to the NE nearly parallel through the Jackson Lake area. This particular tornado continued northeast and would intensify to EF2 as it crossed Hwy 36 north of Keys Ferry Road and Haley Road. The fatality and critical injury directly associated with this tornado occurred along Haley Road when a tree fell onto a vehicle injuring the driver and fatally wounding a passenger. EF2 damage was noted East of hwy36 along Haley Road, Pocahontas St. Chickasaw lane and several neighborhoods along the lake. The tornado crossed into Southern Newton County causing severe damage along Parker Road, Ray Road, Malcom Rd, Quarry Ct, Pebble Ridge Dr, Hunters Trace, Campbell Rd and Hwy 212 as it entered Jasper County near the Franks Restaurant. EF1 to low end EF2 damage was intermittent along Yancy Rd, Dallas Tr, Gem Lane, Lee's Cove, Alcovy N. Dr, Rainbow Dr and County Line Road. The Bear Creek Marian was destroyed and several campers were destroyed. The storm continued NE crossing Henderson Mill Road snapping and uprooting trees, County line Trail and Hwy 11 before weakening and lifting as it approached Margery Lake. A second fatality was resulted the following day when a lineman was knocked out of a bucket truck in Jasper County after being struck by a large tree branch while attempting to restore powerlines. The fatality, is considered indirect but will be tied to this particular tornado. Widespread wind damage can be seen via areal survey and ground survey throughout northern Butts, Southern Newton and Western Jasper counties and surveying this particular storm was a challenge to discern where the tornado actually ended and where the severe wind damage started.

EF1-intensity damage continued for another 1.6 miles towards Interstate Route 65, as a few barns were completely destroyed across this rural portion of southwestern Clinton County.\nThe tornado caused minimal EF0-intensity damage for the following 2 miles, including where it crossed Interstate Route 65, while occasionally dropping debris the vortex had picked up earlier in its path. The circulation restrengthened to EF1 intensity for its final 1.7 miles, causing significant damage just before ending about 3 miles southwest of Frankfort: hardwood trees were downed at County Road 400 South; before extensive damage near County Road 300 South which included the destruction of several barns/farm outbuildings among corresponding tree damage, including a concrete tower and a silo (at separate buildings) both leaning southwest, while another farm outbuilding's roof panels were wrapped around trees.", "f_scale": 2, "wind": 120, "source": "NWS Storm Survey", "state_1": "IN", "state_2": null, "state_3": null, "spc_id": null, "ncei_id": "1089563, 1089837, 1089839", "tornado_type": "Tornado", "storm_morphology": "QLCS", "satellite_scar": "False" }, "geometry": { "type": "LineString", "coordinates": [ [ -86.717101433, 40.154015413 ], [ -86.680022575, 40.172381371 ], [ -86.640883781, 40.189693295 ], [ -86.628524162, 40.197823129 ], [ -86.615134575, 40.2067386 ], [ -86.594878532, 40.21512856 ], [ -86.577712395, 40.229284263 ], [ -86.556688542, 40.243199551 ] ] } },

Peak winds in Union County were estimated at 90 mph. This tornado crossed from Union County into Lee County along County Road 2700 around 12:00 am CST on April 1. A poorly anchored home sustained roof removal and collapse of several walls, consistent with a high-end EF1 rating. A church had significant roof damage along County Road 231, and other structures were damaged along County Roads 341 and 2726. In particular, a mobile home/camper trailer was flipped and destroyed in this area. The intensity of the damage picked up along County Road 417, where a vacant double-wide mobile home was swept away and a couple other homes sustained minor damage. Tree damage here was significant as well. The tornado attained EF2 intensity along County Road 503, where a two-story brick home sustained major roof loss, which began with the uplift of the front porch awning. An adjacent 32x32 two-story garage was swept completely away and destroyed, although it appeared to be poorly anchored. Along County Road 601, another home had total roof loss and several walls collapsed, and extensive tree damage was observed across the road. Further eastward along County Road 601, another home was damaged, and several cedar trees were snapped, consistent with an EF1 rating. Another area of heavier tree damage occurred along County Road 2788 at Highway 45. In addition, the sign at the entrance to an industrial park was damaged. Along Pratts Road, a church and a shop building were damaged, and a few more homes were damaged along the north side of Pratts Road. The tornado weakened significantly after this point, with only lighter, more sporadic tree damage. A couple more homes sustained minor roof damage along Cemetery Road and Highway 370 before the tornado dissipated after crossing County Road 2890. Peak estimated winds in Lee County were 120 mph.

The tornado began in far western Pontotoc County, around Antioch Road, with a few trees downed and tree limbs snapped. Along Highway 9 and Houpt Road, tree damage became more significant, and a few homes and outbuildings sustained damage. A brick home on Highway 9 sustained heavy damage to the front side, mostly caused by a large uprooted tree. Damage in this area was rated EF-1. Weaker damage continued south of the Springville community before another area of EF-1 damage was noted along Highway 341 at Foster Lane. Here a brick home sustained significant roof loss, caused partially by the uplift of an open-air carport. A few other homes had roof damage as the tornado continued to the south side of Pontotoc. A swath of more intense damage ran from Highway 15 across Highway 41 and East 10th Street, with numerous homes sustaining considerable damage. The tornado reached EF-2 intensity in this area, based on a double-wide mobile home being swept away, two brick homes having significant roof loss, and a large anchored garage being destroyed. Bolted footings that remained in place were observed in the garage. Damage to other homes in the area was rated EF-1, and many trees were uprooted, with a good number of snaps as well. Significant tree damage, along with minor structural damage, continued across Horseshoe Bend, Hall Road, and New Hope Road, maintaining EF-1 intensity. After briefly weakening near Highway 278, the tornado encountered the College Hill Lane neighborhood along Old Highway 6. Here, more significant damage was observed to structures and trees, mostly pines. A site-built home lost part of its roof, and a neighboring double-wide was swept away and scattered south and east, resulting in a fatality. Additionally, other homes sustained minor damage, and a small barber shop building was rolled and destroyed. Damage continued in the EF-0 range from Faulkner Road to near the Lee County line, with several more homes being damaged and numerous trees being uprooted. The more severe home damage in this area appeared to be a combination of tree failure or uplift of garages/carports, thus the rating was kept at high-end EF-0. At Country Oaks Circle, a church sign and cemetery sign were blown down, and several headstones in the cemetery sustained damage. The damage path appeared to end in a grove of trees just south of Old Highway 6, and no damage was observed on County Road 41 at the Pontotoc/Lee county line. Along the track, 12 homes were destroyed and 120 were damaged. Peak estimated winds in Pontotoc County were 120 mph.

The EF2 tornado then cross the North Palm Beach Waterway where it completely destroyed a manufactured home along the canal bank. As the tornado moved NNE it crossed into the Point at Palm Beach Gardens community where it created minor structural damage to the complex, but had some of its most photographed moments as cars were displaced, flipped, and stacked on each other. The tornado then moved through the City Centre where considerable tree, light post, and street sign damage was noted. As it crossed PGA Blvd the tornado destroyed a dry cleaners business, collapsed large light poles, and even caused a concrete electrical pole to lean.

No visual convergence was noted until the area near N Old Corry Field Rd and W Gregory St. Several large limbs were noted and few uproots at this location in a loosely convergent pattern. This more concentrated damage continued south-southeast across US 98 to Barrancas Ave with a several mile wider swath of damaging winds. The path at this point seems discontinuous with several weak areas of convergence resulting in likely high end EF-0 damage embedded within a broader damaging wind swath. A more concentrated area of convergence appears around Fairway Drive on the north side of the Pensacola County Club. Several hardwoods had large 2 foot in diameter branches snapped and several softwood pines were snapped as a more continuous path extended across the country club and Bayshore Dr before moving out over Pensacola Bay.\nThe tornado then likely continued as a waterspout traversing Pensacola Bay dodging the western tip of Gulf Breeze before wrapping back southeast towards Pensacola Beach. The tornado quickly strengthened as it crossed Fort Pickens Rd near Galvez CT. Significant damage to homes built to withstand significant hurricanes was noted and thus damage estimates from this location leaned on the higher side for given damage indicators. Several of the homes across a quarter mile swath had damage to siding including several sides beings completely removed. A few homes lost 20 to 60 percent of metal roofing material even with proper hurricane code anchors. Several bottom floor garages were completely gutted as garage doors were blown in and destroyed. Bottom exterior walls blew out leading to complete exposure of the bottom floors. Several palm trees across the area were snapped a few feet off the ground. The most notable damage was right along Fort Pickens Rd where a house under construction had the entire top floor and roof removed. This damage was put on the lower end of estimates as the house was under construction and an opening on the north side may have helped the failure of the upper walls and floors. However, a large dumpster likely weighing several hundred pounds was thrown roughly 50-70 yards due east and was deposited between two palm trees about 2 feet off the ground. The damage to the home, dumpster combined with a garage door that failed being wrapped around a concrete piling resulted in the peak wind estimate of 120 mph.\nThe tornado likely crossed over Fort Pickens Rd and into the Gulf of Mexico where it likely dissipated. One other interesting damage note was that at least two boats were tossed on the Pensacola Bay side. One boat was found about 20-30 yards from the boat lift upside down in the water. The other boat was thrown off the lift and was reportedly found near Deer Point about a mile north across the bay. This boat likely floated over there but still impressive.

There were hundreds of large trees either uprooted or snapped at their bases. One home sustained damage to its roof, the top of its chimney was blown off, windows were blown in, and an exterior door was dislodged from its framing. Damage was consistent with winds of around 115 mph which is classified as EF-2 on the Enhanced Fujita Scale.\nThe tornado then tracked into Johnston where it crossed I-295 at Exit 10 and lifted a vehicle into the air before dropping it back onto the highway. The driver was transported to an area hospital with minor injuries. From there, the tornado moved across Bridle Way and Carriage Way where a number of trees were snapped or uprooted, some of which fell onto homes or vehicles. Some homes also lost some singles from their roofs. A metal Stop sign pole was bent in half and the sign was blown away. The tornado then caused damage in Highland Memorial Park Cemetery where a number of large trees were either snapped or uprooted. The damage observed in Johnston was consistent with winds of 90 to 100 mph which is classified as EF-1 on the Enhanced Fujita Scale.\nFinally, the tornado crossed into North Providence. Similar to Johnston, a number of trees were either snapped or uprooted, some falling onto homes or vehicles. Most of the damage observed was to the north of Mineral Spring Avenue. One of the harder hit areas included Lydia Avenue, Armand Drive, and Bennett Street where two homes were made uninhabitable from fallen trees. The damage observed in North Providence was consistent with winds of 90 to 100 mph which is classified as EF-1 on the Enhanced Fujita Scale.\nThe National Weather Service would like to thank the Rhode Island Emergency Management Agency, the Scituate Police Department, the Johnston Police Department, the North Providence Fire Department, and Skywarn Amateur Radio Operators for their assistance with the damage survey.", "f_scale": 2, "wind": 115, "source": "NWS Storm Survey", "state_1": "RI", "state_2": null, "state_3": null, "spc_id": null, "ncei_id": "1120133", "tornado_type": "Tornado", "storm_morphology": "QLCS", "satellite_scar": "True" }, "geometry": { "type": "LineString", "coordinates": [ [ -71.5741, 41.7987 ], [ -71.511315929605246, 41.846334285169128 ], [ -71.501670650445064, 41.852625952527561 ], [ -71.495357111705303, 41.855658784069973 ], [ -71.4353, 41.8735 ] ] } },
