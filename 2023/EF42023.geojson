{ "type": "Feature", "properties": { "fid": 6, "Start_time": "2023-03-25T00:57:00", "End_time": "2023-03-25T02:08:00", "Width": 1320, "Length": 59.3543, "Fatalities": 16, "Injuries": 165, "Damage": 16, "Narrative": "This long track, violent tornado began over northern Issaquena County near Grant Rd, downing multiple trees and damaging two older outbuildings. The tornado continued northeastward, producing tree damage as it crossed the Steele Bayou Canal then into Sharkey County. At this point, the tornado began to increase in size and intensity, and there was evidence of multiple vortices at multiple points along the path in Sharkey County. A very high percentage of trees were snapped along the path through a wooded area south of Bear Lake Rd. On the western outskirts of the city of Rolling Fork, homes began to be impacted with significant roof damage along Bear Lake Rd. Several tall wooden utility poles were snapped along Bear Lake Rd and MS Highway 826. The first indications of EF3 to EF4 damage occurred along Pinkins Rd, where each structure along the dead end road, including several manufactured homes and a site built home, was demolished. Structures on the west end of the road were scattered radially southeastward, and structures on the east end of the road were scattered northward. Additionally, debarking was observed on several hardwood trees, with only stubs of the main branches of some trees remaining. Across MS 826 and along Fleetwood Rd, an older metal building was swept away, a small home was destroyed and numerous manufactured homes were destroyed. As the tornado moved into the western side of Rolling Fork, the tornadic wind field was broad, encompassing the area from Race St where exterior damage occurred to the Sharkey Issaquena Hospital to Bear Lake Rd on the south end. The corridor of greatest damage on the west side of the city, up to EF3, extended from 7th St between Martin Ave and Joor Ave to 3rd St between Southern Ave and Lewis Ave to S 1st St near Wright Ave. In this area, multiple homes lost most exterior walls, several more lost roofs and some walls, and even more received at least minor damage. Additional debarking of trees was noted near the center of the path. After the tornado crossed Deer Creek into the eastern side of Rolling Fork, some intensification occurred, with additional EF4 damage noted. Two homes, one along Sharkey St and one along Collette Ave, had all walls collapsed. A lodge on Parkway Ave was demolished, but there was evidence the structure was compromised by flying debris. Large metal buildings at an agriculture business at the intersection of East St and West Ave were destroyed. Further south along the periphery of the tornado, roof damage occurred at the fire station and at Rolling Fork Elementary School and South Delta High School. The tornado then crossed Rolling Fork Creek, damaging and destroying several structures along McLaurin St and China St. A water tower east of Hicks Ave was downed, though it appeared to be compromised near the base by impacts from flying debris. The roof was removed from the Rolling Fork US Post Office, portions of Rolling Fork City Hall, and portions of the Rolling Fork Police Department. The Sharkey County Courthouse received damage to the roof and some windows, with the cupola removed. Homes and businesses were destroyed along Walnut St, with all or most walls downed. With two of the businesses, the structure was compromised by tossed vehicles or a metal door on the side of the building. Another area of EF4 damage was along Mulberry St and Hunt St, where additional homes and businesses had all walls collapsed, Several other structures had roofs removed and some walls collapsed as far north as Lindsay St and Magnolia St. As the tornado approached US 61, several businesses were impacted, especially in the area between Walnut St and Rosenwald Ave. Several of these businesses were metal building systems that were nearly or completely destroyed. A few were brick structures with most or all walls collapsed, leaving piles of debris on or near the slab. Around 30 mobile or manufactured homes at the Chuck's Dairy Bar property were destroyed. A considerable amount of debris was visible in aerial imagery along the path scattered downwind in fields east northeast of the city.", "F_scale": 4, "Wind": 195, "Source": null, "State_1": "MS", "State_2": null, "State_3": null, "SPC_id": null, "NCEI_id": null, "Tornado_type": "Tornado", "Storm_morphology": "Supercell" }, "geometry": { "type": "LineString", "coordinates": [ [ -90.999299222, 32.841397587 ], [ -90.986510449, 32.845219483 ], [ -90.969417376, 32.856522091 ], [ -90.954993359, 32.866687564 ], [ -90.949774058, 32.870090032 ], [ -90.93603265, 32.875377967 ], [ -90.931188581, 32.877582169 ], [ -90.926225153, 32.87967932 ], [ -90.91961619, 32.883193233 ], [ -90.912923247, 32.887848485 ], [ -90.904117738, 32.893005574 ], [ -90.896297782, 32.895968313 ], [ -90.894070797, 32.897195338 ], [ -90.888012872, 32.899531214 ], [ -90.885818825, 32.900456801 ], [ -90.883847402, 32.90133959 ], [ -90.880966709, 32.903260526 ], [ -90.877529458, 32.90552934 ], [ -90.876266138, 32.906747607 ], [ -90.874973469, 32.907752588 ], [ -90.87309576, 32.908784335 ], [ -90.871969124, 32.909372897 ], [ -90.871579645, 32.909806242 ], [ -90.871063319, 32.910202555 ], [ -90.870076267, 32.910771127 ], [ -90.869746355, 32.910879212 ], [ -90.867571757, 32.912186818 ], [ -90.856970483, 32.916876569 ], [ -90.845276051, 32.92232529 ], [ -90.823643137, 32.932905077 ], [ -90.815109689, 32.936253672 ], [ -90.797942719, 32.943317207 ], [ -90.784871859, 32.949580386 ], [ -90.77468787, 32.954222898 ], [ -90.768200111, 32.957368951 ], [ -90.76397429, 32.958931962 ], [ -90.759563278, 32.961019198 ], [ -90.757312905, 32.961914886 ], [ -90.749092471, 32.96594013 ], [ -90.747568977, 32.966772758 ], [ -90.745747757, 32.967362344 ], [ -90.74391849, 32.967983431 ], [ -90.741314971, 32.96949785 ], [ -90.736966426, 32.972105981 ], [ -90.734313721, 32.973496594 ], [ -90.732194776, 32.974671173 ], [ -90.723071612, 32.979560581 ], [ -90.721334882, 32.980655205 ], [ -90.717736995, 32.98303453 ], [ -90.71468023, 32.985451737 ], [ -90.711727506, 32.987149541 ], [ -90.704000061, 32.99123849 ], [ -90.696481225, 32.994775019 ], [ -90.69067047, 32.996897329 ], [ -90.684378578, 33.000934312 ], [ -90.675798394, 33.005535963 ], [ -90.665839443, 33.010637381 ], [ -90.640767239, 33.023213382 ], [ -90.630510471, 33.029698965 ], [ -90.622978828, 33.03280216 ], [ -90.601177833, 33.045150898 ], [ -90.578818939, 33.055744428 ], [ -90.570858143, 33.059521101 ], [ -90.563069008, 33.06293795 ], [ -90.554056785, 33.066552473 ], [ -90.551215417, 33.067941383 ], [ -90.549779765, 33.068616831 ], [ -90.549043498, 33.068953992 ], [ -90.548679388, 33.06913381 ], [ -90.54826901, 33.069319247 ], [ -90.542734272, 33.072024337 ], [ -90.53745896, 33.074867263 ], [ -90.534530995, 33.076773223 ], [ -90.530308757, 33.07954478 ], [ -90.52811005, 33.08065654 ], [ -90.526335169, 33.081528554 ], [ -90.522558619, 33.083429842 ], [ -90.518095423, 33.085827742 ], [ -90.515690831, 33.087184679 ], [ -90.513192047, 33.088430386 ], [ -90.511078466, 33.089540512 ], [ -90.508704252, 33.090592523 ], [ -90.506446291, 33.091744991 ], [ -90.504212011, 33.092850581 ], [ -90.493095539, 33.101880659 ], [ -90.456317089, 33.120195386 ], [ -90.422092102, 33.138506294 ], [ -90.380974942, 33.158161784 ], [ -90.360718899, 33.167358659 ], [ -90.323167973, 33.181134205 ], [ -90.28909319, 33.197331619 ], [ -90.277634793, 33.201981985 ], [ -90.232831173, 33.217062557 ], [ -90.223561459, 33.219503928 ], [ -90.184594326, 33.235586558 ], [ -90.172921353, 33.239750328 ], [ -90.113698178, 33.263293436 ], [ -90.112582379, 33.263580508 ] ] } },

The tornado tracked to the northeast, on the western fringe of Keota, and crossed into Washington County near the intersection of Keokuk-Washington Road and 180th St. The tornado then continued through northwest Washington county, extreme southeast Iowa County, and into far southwest Johnson County. The tornado severely damaged several homes near Keota, wiping one house completely off its foundation, resulting in EF-4 level damage. A car was lofted in the air and tossed about 1000 feet into a nearby field and trees were completely debarked with only stubs of the largest branches remaining. As the tornado tracked west of Wellman, Iowa it knocked over a 325 ft cell phone tower. The tornado began to dissipate as it tracked into far southwest Johnson County. The tornado was rated EF-4 in Keokuk County, EF-3 in Washington County, and EF-1 in Iowa and Johnson Counties.", "F_scale": 4, "Wind": 170, "Source": "NWS Storm Survey", "State_1": "IA", "State_2": null, "State_3": null, "SPC_id": null, "NCEI_id": "1087061, 1087089, 1087090, 1087095", "Tornado_type": "Tornado", "Storm_morphology": "Supercell" }, "geometry": { "type": "LineString", "coordinates": [ [ -92.030714231, 41.313476906 ], [ -92.011263198, 41.328241777 ], [ -92.003420072, 41.334844608 ], [ -91.997540669, 41.340225715 ], [ -91.994955367, 41.344030993 ], [ -91.986425595, 41.35285507 ], [ -91.980932431, 41.35810584 ], [ -91.969216542, 41.366219893 ], [ -91.956556516, 41.38056687 ], [ -91.946428494, 41.390838145 ], [ -91.935356336, 41.402073513 ], [ -91.926816182, 41.411424213 ], [ -91.918404775, 41.419453922 ], [ -91.912997441, 41.424023553 ], [ -91.902783589, 41.432277143 ], [ -91.894844251, 41.440079074 ], [ -91.880982595, 41.451965429 ], [ -91.872742849, 41.461614368 ], [ -91.865533071, 41.468817973 ], [ -91.853173452, 41.47544201 ], [ -91.848366933, 41.481872467 ], [ -91.842702108, 41.494924331 ], [ -91.837809758, 41.502124234 ], [ -91.832488256, 41.509770392 ], [ -91.82995625, 41.514655008 ], [ -91.827510076, 41.518960877 ], [ -91.824463086, 41.521724194 ], [ -91.821416097, 41.523234329 ], [ -91.818669515, 41.524583781 ], [ -91.817124562, 41.526254493 ], [ -91.815150457, 41.526543651 ], [ -91.812875943, 41.528021545 ], [ -91.811760144, 41.530784476 ], [ -91.810730176, 41.534318284 ], [ -91.807511525, 41.537594916 ], [ -91.805837827, 41.539297414 ], [ -91.802404599, 41.541642291 ], [ -91.797168927, 41.543922842 ] ] } }
