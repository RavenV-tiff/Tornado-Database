Tree limbs 1 to 3 inches in diameter were broken and scattered across the property. A few shingles were torn off the farmhouse, an augur was pushed approximately 5 feet to the southwest digging a groove in the soil, and a calving hut was blown 20 feet and rotated about 100 degrees. A few hundred yards south down County Road 35 an electrical pole roughly 50 years old was snapped at the base but still upright as it was still attached to the electrical wires. A plastic 5 gallon bucket from the farmhouse was thrown about half a mile away from the home in a field off of County Road 6. Finally, the tornado dissipated over an open field just to the west of Highway 71, about 2 miles southeast of the farmhouse at 6:45 PM MDT.

The tornado crossed Alabama Highway 10 and entered Henry County just north of and parallel to County Rd (CR) 54, before crossing CR 54 just before CR 216. The tornado reached its maximum width of approximately 200 yards wide as well as its maximum intensity, with relatively more widespread tree damage, as well as superficial damage to several manufactured homes. The tornado continued northeastward through forested land before crossing CR 75 and CR 235. It continued across the East Fork of the Choctawhatchee River before crossing CR 29. As the tornado crossed CR 235, it struck a chicken farm with surgical precision, slicing across all 6 chicken barns like a can opener, causing primarily narrow minor damage to each barn. The tornado continued to the northeast and dissipated before crossing CR 54 yet another time.", "f_scale": 0, "wind": 75, "source": null, "state_1": "AL", "state_2": null, "state_3": null, "spc_id": null, "ncei_id": null, "tornado_type": "Tornado", "storm_morphology": "Supercell", "satellite_scar": null }, "geometry": { "type": "LineString", "coordinates": [ [ -85.442013096999972, 31.623370781 ], [ -85.440296483, 31.62399201 ], [ -85.433985781999979, 31.626112377000027 ], [ -85.427678300000025, 31.62828659500002 ], [ -85.41497857600001, 31.632675985 ], [ -85.405903054000021, 31.636005571 ], [ -85.396876884, 31.639230909 ], [ -85.391761374999987, 31.642497236999986 ], [ -85.38738186400002, 31.644161413 ], [ -85.35553653300002, 31.655594278000024 ], [ -85.31716806999998, 31.668778960999987 ] ] } },
