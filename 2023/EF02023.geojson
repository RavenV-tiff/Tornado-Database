The tornado crossed US Route 52 causing intermittent minor damage to trees as it moved toward Lisbon. At this time, the tornado was likely less than 20 yards wide. The track continued east-southeast in crop fields between Joliet Road and Whitewillow Road. The tornado then crossed Illinois Route 47 along Whitewillow Road, and continued eastward causing additional sporadic minor tree damage before lifting in a crop field east of Ashley Road.", "F_scale": 0, "Wind": 85, "Source": null, "State_1": "IL", "State_2": null, "State_3": null, "SPC_id": null, "NCEI_id": null, "Tornado_type": "Tornado", "Storm_morphology": "QLCS" }, "geometry": { "type": "LineString", "coordinates": [ [ -88.571023227000012, 41.489786712000011 ], [ -88.567371775000026, 41.48811436699998 ], [ -88.565751721000026, 41.487374967999983 ], [ -88.562951495, 41.487198154 ], [ -88.560591150999983, 41.487141894999979 ], [ -88.558316638, 41.486876672999983 ], [ -88.555301835000023, 41.486587338 ], [ -88.549241380000012, 41.485772108999981 ], [ -88.543521573000021, 41.48518887 ], [ -88.512955119000026, 41.482721384 ], [ -88.49234502500002, 41.479811719999987 ], [ -88.48812859200001, 41.479916213000024 ], [ -88.484626752, 41.480124053 ], [ -88.482974511, 41.47981861300002 ], [ -88.480764371000021, 41.479609626000013 ], [ -88.477605335000021, 41.479193778000024 ], [ -88.424466155, 41.473917191 ], [ -88.404381774, 41.473724263 ] ] } },

The tornado then crossed an inlet and uprooted several more trees along Beechwood Rd, before continuing to the Brigadoon neighborhood.

After crossing State Route 101, more significant tree damage occurred in a forested area just to the south of Pea Ridge Road. The tornado then appeared to cross some farm fields before lifting along Liberty Pike, where some minor tree damage was noted.

The tornado is believed to have first touched down in the vicinity of Chrisholm MetroPark in the Historical Farmstead Area north of Woodsdale Road. At the park, tree damage was observed within the northeast section of the park. The circulation likely crossed Woodsdale Road and the Great Miami River as it moved southeast, however, no damage has been reported likely due to the weak nature of the tornado and lack of road access. The next evidence of the tornado was found south of the Great Miami River in a neighborhood west of the Wright Brothers Memorial Highway. Security camera video from a residence on Dedham Drive shows a circulation quickly moving through the area, tossing light debris. Small tree limbs were also reported down in the neighborhood. Given the lack of damage to surrounding structures, the tornado was likely very weak. In combination with other video evidence from the Monroe area of a condensed funnel intermittingly nearing the surface and available radar data, confidence was high enough to confirm a tornado between these two locations.
