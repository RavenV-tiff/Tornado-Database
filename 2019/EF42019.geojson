{ "type": "Feature", "properties": { "fid": 4, "Start_time": "2019-03-03T20:00:00", "End_time": "2019-03-03T21:16:00", "Width": 1600, "Length": 68.04, "Fatalities": 23, "Injuries": 90, "Damage": 1750000, "Narrative": "National Weather Service meteorologists surveyed damage in far northeast Macon County and determined that it was consistent with an EF1 tornado, with maximum sustained winds near 88 mph.\nThe tornado touched down near Rogers Road just north of U.S. Highway 80. Numerous pine trees were uprooted as the tornado tracked northeast and crossed Callaway Baker Road, Highway 33 and Highway 43. The tornado began to strengthen as it moved east of Highway 43 and uprooted more pine trees before crossing into Lee County near Lee Road 812. National Weather Service meteorologists surveyed damage in far southern Lee County and determined that it was consistent with an EF4 tornado, with maximum sustained winds near 170 mph.\nThis track is a continuation of a track that began in Macon County. The tornado crossed into Lee County near Lee Road 812 and tracked northeast to County Road 29 where it removed the roof and collapsed several cinder block walls of a church. The tornado continued to intensify as it approached County Road 11, where it peeled sheet metal off of the porch of a home and ripped some sheet metal off of two outdoor storage sheds and continued to uproot numerous pine trees. Debris from structures and their contents were strewn along a tree line to the east of their original location and some evidence of weak ground rowing was observed along the surface tornado path.\nThe tornado reached its peak intensity just south of the intersection of Lee County Road 36 and Lee County Road 39, where it rolled a manufactured home and emptied its contents nearby on the northern side of the track. Additional damage toward the southern portion of the track included the complete destruction of a house with all debris tossed a short distance from the foundation. The tornado bent the frame of a car around the remnant of a large tree whose upper portion had broken off and totaled three vehicles by severe impacts into the bases of two remaining tree stubs. Farther east on the other side of a small lake, a well-anchored and constructed home was leveled with debris removed from the foundation and anchored bolt screws remaining intact. Toward the northern edge of the tornado, the destruction of two double-wide and a single-wide manufactured home was observed. This was the peak intensity of the tornado due to the combination of damage to the two houses along with extensive severe tree damage including trees snapped at their bases and large trees with expansive root systems uprooted along with some sporadic evidence of ground rowing.\nThe tornado began to decrease in intensity as it continued east roughly paralleling Lee County Road 39 where two manufactured homes were destroyed with most debris deposited away from the original location and both of the metal frames of the mobile homes could not be located. Another manufactured home was destroyed with its contents deposited in a swath from the site into the remains of a nearby tree line. A car was found in an overturned position against a hardy tree stripped of most limbs with a mattress from a bed wrapped around the mid portion of the tree. A badly mangled metal frame of a manufactured home and debris displaced nearby was all that remained of one residence. Nearby a tractor trailer rig was on its side and shoved around a sturdy tree while a nearby site-built home lost nearly all of its exterior walls with debris remaining on or near the home site. Severe tree destruction continued in this area with trees snapped at their bases and uprooted. To the north of Lee County Road 39, significant debris was deposited in a wooded area where the tornado performed significant timber damage and toppled at least one high-tension power line tower.\nAfter demolishing two double-wide and a single-wide manufactured home the tornado tracked northeast and crossed Lee County Road 51 just north of the intersection with Lee County Road 39. A double-wide manufactured home was moved off of its base and the exterior walls collapsed on a family residence along with significant tree damage. Some weakening occurred farther east as the tornado crossed Lee County Road 38 where it deposited a large amount of debris into a ragged forested area. The tornado crossed Lee County Road 100 and Lee County Road 166 where it caused damage to trees with some trunks snapped and some trees uprooted.\nTornado damage was observed along Lee County Road 165 and along portions of Lee County Road 40 and Lee County Road 2049. Exterior walls of a family residence were removed and a significant loss of roofing material from a house and a manufactured home were observed. The tornado flipped a manufactured home and deposited its contents nearby along with destroying the roof and walls of a single-wide manufactured home.\nThe tornado crossed Lee County Road 170 and County Road 175, and then Highway 169 with significant damage to timber along this path. The tornado crossed Lee County Road 245 and Lee County Road 179 with damage to the roof of a house near County Road 239 along with more timber damage. As it approached Smiths Station, the tornado crossed Fullers Lake where it rolled a manufactured home and caused some loss of roofing material to a house. Additional damage occurred along Lee County Road 294 and Lee County Road 298 where a professional building lost some of its roofing materials. Damage also occurred to siding and roofing at several small homes that were not well constructed. As the tornado crossed U.S. Highway 280 it caused some roof damage to a restaurant, damaged a billboard and collapsed a cellular service communications tower. The tornado moved across Lee County Road 318 where some roof damage to homes occurred along with significant timber damage. The tornado moved tracked towards the Chattahoochee River where it caused roof damage to some houses near the river and downed a metal high-tension power line tower. The tornado crossed the Chattahoochee River and continued into Georgia.\nThere were 23 fatalities and 90 injuries. The American Red Cross estimated 225 homes were destroyed, while another 133 homes sustained major damage. A National Weather Service survey found that the deadly EF4 tornado that crossed Macon and Lee Counties in Alabama moved across the Chattahoochee River into Muscogee County Georgia with an EF1 intensity. The tornado entered the county in the Standing Boy Creek State Park, moving east northeast along Winding Ridge Road, Old River Road and Biggers Road causing extensive damage in forested areas. Large swaths of softwood trees were uprooted or snapped near their bases. The tornado continued east northeast crossing Winding Ridge Road and I-185 southwest of Fortson. As the tornado crossed U.S. Highway 27 between Woodridge Road and Almond Road, it reached EF3 intensity, toppling a large cell tower along with a swath of pine trees with wind speeds estimated to be around 140 mph. Around a dozen metal guidewires attached to the tower, and measuring over one inch in diameter, were snapped. The tornado crossed into Harris County after crossing Highway 27. No injuries were reported along the Muscogee County portion of the tornado path. A National Weather Service survey found an EF2 tornado moved out of Muscogee County into Harris County just north of Gray Rock Road west of Heiferhorn Creek, snapping hundreds of trees. The Tornado moved east northeast up Rip Shin Road to Highway 315 as it entered Ellerslie downing hundreds more trees. Minor roof damage was noted at several homes with shingles pulled off. One home had a portion of the attic and top floor removed. Further east northeast along highway 315 and Mount Airy Road, there were hundreds of softwood trees blown down, as well as a home with significant damage to the top floor. Several homes had missing shingles and a carport was destroyed. The tornado then continued across Ridgeway Road, just north of Highway 315, where several dozen softwood trees were snapped near their bases. The short distance from Ridgeway Road to the Talbot County line saw numerous additional trees blown down along and north of Highway 315. No injuries were reported along the Harris County portion of the tornado path. A National Weather Service survey found an EF2 tornado moved out of Harris County into Talbot County increasing to EF3 intensity along Highway 315 where a small church and a mobile home were destroyed and dozens of trees were downed. Extensive damage occurred to a two-story home. The Humble Zion Church which was completely demolished with no walls left standing, was constructed of cinder blocks and mortar. The tornado continued east northeast along or just south of Highway 315, and weakened once again with EF1 wind damage found through forested areas in and around the highway as it crossed Callier Road, O'Neal Road, and Mitchell Road. Next, the tornado moved across the northern side of the city of Talbotton, causing extensive damage to trees and completely destroying numerous homes. Damage was observed along Adams Road on the Northwest side of town as wide swaths of trees were observed to be snapped. The tornado intensified again as it crossed Washington Avenue, the main north-south road through town, causing EF2 damage. A few manufactured homes were completely turned over, twisted, and destroyed. Contents of the homes were blown over a quarter mile into the woods behind them. One site-built, single family home was twisted at least 10 feet off of it's foundation and another had its second story completely removed. Two apartment buildings were completely blown down with the foundation slabs laid bare. At least a dozen cars were destroyed by wind-blown debris. Several cars were blown several feet from where they were parked and one sedan was rolled up onto the top of a small pick-up truck. Several other manufactured homes lost portions of their roofing and some lost whole rooms to the winds. Seven injuries were reported in Talbotton. The tornado continued east northeast out of Talbotton, continuing to snap and uproot hundreds of trees along the path. Another manufactured home was found to have been displaced and torn apart, with another having its rear half collapsed from winds and falling trees. The storm continued moving to the east northeast between Highway 80 and Boot Kelly and Pobiddy Roads. On Poplar Cross Road, between Pobiddy Road and Highway 80, hundreds of softwood trees were snapped near their bases. The tornado dissipated just east of the intersection of George Smith Road and Carl Mathis Road. Seven injuries were reported along the Talbot County portion of the tornado path.", "F_scale": 4, "Wind": 170, "Source": "NWS Storm Survey", "State_1": "AL", "State_2": "GA", "State_3": null }, "geometry": { "type": "LineString", "coordinates": [ [ -85.48185001600001, 32.447190184000021 ], [ -85.450873183999988, 32.453054668999982 ], [ -85.422935295, 32.460478093 ], [ -85.400780785, 32.46709755 ], [ -85.390405464000025, 32.469955196 ], [ -85.386231947, 32.470806045000018 ], [ -85.383496094, 32.47107759 ], [ -85.37358265, 32.472281887 ], [ -85.368719267000017, 32.473653163 ], [ -85.363948155, 32.476065291 ], [ -85.343458224000017, 32.481515646999981 ], [ -85.313801574000024, 32.488844417999985 ], [ -85.299811171999977, 32.494111207 ], [ -85.274892384, 32.501541541999984 ], [ -85.255537558000015, 32.505517907000012 ], [ -85.238785553000014, 32.507792559 ], [ -85.221705246, 32.513720498 ], [ -85.201421309000011, 32.518799468 ], [ -85.18811512000002, 32.523005459 ], [ -85.165887113999986, 32.533200320999981 ], [ -85.150777681000022, 32.537794908000023 ], [ -85.135574150000025, 32.53840518200002 ], [ -85.133203077000019, 32.538638536 ], [ -85.123332548, 32.54258194800002 ], [ -85.110211181000011, 32.546002445 ], [ -85.103344726999978, 32.547738872000025 ], [ -85.098141242, 32.549961811 ], [ -85.08496623100001, 32.558715568000025 ], [ -85.068368721000013, 32.562931174000028 ], [ -85.066555547, 32.563924009 ], [ -85.060271893999982, 32.568595709000022 ], [ -85.055635737999978, 32.573262278000016 ], [ -85.045984490000023, 32.577355996 ], [ -85.032294494999974, 32.579344954000021 ], [ -85.018089515999975, 32.581080735 ], [ -84.990795357000025, 32.587481140000023 ], [ -84.956505997000022, 32.594459590999975 ], [ -84.926765663000026, 32.599015178 ], [ -84.911187392999977, 32.600822886 ], [ -84.898784858999989, 32.601943646999985 ], [ -84.883807403999981, 32.602558252 ], [ -84.866941672999985, 32.608559465999974 ], [ -84.828189118000012, 32.616512262000015 ], [ -84.809864265999977, 32.622982426000021 ], [ -84.798749191000013, 32.627681134 ], [ -84.757035476999988, 32.637330784000028 ], [ -84.742143852000027, 32.641450541999973 ], [ -84.722102387, 32.644919664999975 ], [ -84.713304741, 32.646148279999977 ], [ -84.703348381000012, 32.646726446 ], [ -84.689400894000016, 32.649002939000013 ], [ -84.671033126999987, 32.65384481000001 ], [ -84.667943222000019, 32.65482038 ], [ -84.663050872999975, 32.656590830000027 ], [ -84.632795554999973, 32.661034867000012 ], [ -84.607175095, 32.666562506999981 ], [ -84.577649338000015, 32.671439551999981 ], [ -84.553788407000013, 32.679856346 ], [ -84.54048465, 32.686249687999975 ], [ -84.537780983, 32.687188784999989 ], [ -84.530828697, 32.68899471200001 ], [ -84.497354729, 32.69957671100002 ], [ -84.46950267, 32.710843534999981 ], [ -84.44083522, 32.72308376 ], [ -84.413369400000022, 32.734925211000018 ], [ -84.393330946, 32.739280801 ], [ -84.377712358, 32.742869402 ], [ -84.369681580000019, 32.745212998999989 ] ] } },

Numerous homes suffered significant roof damage and removal, including exterior wall collapse and complete garage destruction.\nThe tornado then carved a path east through Trotwood where damage consistent with EF2 wind speeds was widespread and some homes sustained damage consistent with EF3 wind speeds. Structures here again featured roof removal and exterior wall collapse. This was particularly true on the south side of Westbrook Road. A large number of homes and apartment complexes were impacted further east in Trotwood, with most of this damage consistent with high-end EF2 wind speeds.\nThe highest winds were estimated to have occurred in a corridor from eastern Trotwood (between Shiloh Springs Road and Westbrook Road), then southeast between Shiloh Springs Road and Turner Road, into areas along the Stillwater River/Riverside Drive area. Embedded within this zone was higher-end EF3 damage. Areas near Riverside Drive and the Stillwater River exhibited damage consistent with wind speeds of 170 mph, or lower-end EF4 damage. This damage included well-built apartment buildings that sustained complete roof and exterior wall removal. In addition, significant tree devastation was found along the Stillwater River, east of Riverside Drive, that included numerous trees that were debarked and nubbed down to the trunk.\nThe tornado continued southeast through Dayton and Northridge, and crossed I-75 into the Old North Dayton Area, where heavy damage continued to homes and businesses. As the tornado entered Riverside, damage began to lessen in intensity, but plenty of damage consistent with EF1 wind speeds was noted. The tornado continued further to the southeast, causing damage in a subdivision north of Burkhardt Road. The roof of an apartment building on Dodge Court was removed. This is the final known damage caused by this tornado.\nAn 86 year old woman died (indirect) on September 1st, 2019, in part due to injuries suffered when she was trapped in her home during the tornado.", "F_scale": 4, "Wind": 170, "Source": "NWS Storm Survey", "State_1": "OH", "State_2": null, "State_3": null }, "geometry": { "type": "LineString", "coordinates": [ [ -84.465092968000022, 39.824428367999985 ], [ -84.445497821, 39.825179838999986 ], [ -84.420435259999977, 39.826498189 ], [ -84.385588000999974, 39.827289188 ], [ -84.355203937, 39.829398471 ], [ -84.326021503, 39.831639514000017 ], [ -84.30319054, 39.829754407 ], [ -84.275896381, 39.824085589 ], [ -84.205309222999972, 39.809146673999976 ], [ -84.182340931, 39.796789620000027 ], [ -84.158479999, 39.782675859999983 ], [ -84.133932421999987, 39.76961475600001 ], [ -84.111959765999984, 39.757738874999973 ] ] } },

The tornado became wide and intense as it moved south of Lawrence and crossed highway 10 before moving just north of Eudora and over the Kansas river into Leavenworth county. The damage path was one half to one mile at times with the most intense damage surveyed in the high end EF3 range which suggests winds of 150 to 160 mph. The tornado ended in Leavenworth county around 7 pm CDT with a path of around 28 miles total. The tornado did produce EF4 damage in Leavenworth county around Linwood Kansas. This tornado is a continuation of the tornado that formed in Douglas County and crossed the Kansas River into Leavenworth County. As the tornado crossed the Kansas River it became very strong and wide. It produced EF-3 damage to residences along the Kansas River. When the tornado impacted Linwood, Kansas it produced isolated EF-3 and EF-4 damage.
