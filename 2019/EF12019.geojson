The top of a snapped off pine tree landed on a well built brick home. An elderly lady was in the home at the time, but was uninjured. The tree damaged a small portion of the roof. A single wide manufactured home had some damage to the shingles on the roof on the west end of the structure. An old wooden barn had a partially collapsed roof with sheet of tin near the property. Another wooden building suffered damage to the tin roof. The tin blew eastward and was caught in the nearby trees.

This time was estimated from rotational velocity signatures evident on both KLWX Sterling National Weather Service Weather Surveillance Radar (88D) and TBWI FAA Terminal Doppler Weather Radar. Several area residents noted sudden, chaotic winds around 3:20 PM EDT (2:20 PM EST). No concentrated or tornadic damage was found southwest or northeast of this location, although there was sporadic tree damage concluded to be from straight line winds throughout much of northeastern Baltimore County into northwestern Harford County.\nMost of the damage was to softwood (pine) trees. On Corbett Road, two softwood (pine) trees were snapped a third of the way up on the west side of the road, and fell toward the northeast. Across the street in a wooded area, a third tree (hardwood, birch) snapped halfway up and fell toward the east. A fourth tree (softwood, pine) just to the north snapped halfway up, and fell toward the south. The pattern of the tree damage was convergent in nature, implying a circulation reached the surface at this point. Other leaf and small branch debris was noted in the area. The damage was confined to a 100-yard wide path at this location.\nThe tornado continued northeastward with a forward speed of 40 to 50 mph (estimated from TBWI radar), reaching the 2400 block of Monkton Road at 3:20 PM EDT (2:20 PM EST). At this location, four pine trees snapped about halfway up, and fell toward the northeast; one small tree along the southeast side of the path snapped at the base and fell toward the southwest; two other pine trees snapped halfway up and fell toward the north or northwest. There were also numerous large limbs scattered around this area. Damage was confined to a path that expanded slightly in width to about 125 yards.\nThe circulation reached JM Pearce Road just east of MD-138 Shepperd Road at 3:21 PM EDT (2:21 PM EST). At least ten trees were snapped in a 150-yard wide path here. Three trees on the northwest side of the path fell toward the south or southeast, with the rest falling toward the northwest to northeast. All of the trees that fell were softwoods (mainly pines).\nAt 3:22 PM EDT (2:22 PM EST), the tornado reached MD-138 Shepperd Road in the 2900 block. Over a dozen trees were snapped between the base and halfway up at this location. Additionally, half a dozen trees were topped. The trees that were snapped closer to the base were along and southeast of the roadway, and fell facing the northwest, north and northeast. The trees that had their tops snapped off were along the north side of the road, and blew south across the road onto adjacent properties. A house at a horse barn had two screens blown in toward the northeast, and the slide of a swing set on the property was torn off and blew toward the northwest. Steel barns on the property sustained no notable damage, and no shingles or siding were removed from the house.\nThe last instance of tornadic damage was noted at the intersection of Shepperd Road and MD-562/138 Troyer Road. Several softwood trees were snapped here, as well, facing southwest, south and southeast.\nGiven the intermittent tree damage (snapped trees), and the fact that very little if any structural damage was noted, it is concluded that maximum wind speeds were 80 to 90 MPH. Above this speed is when most sturdy structures start sustaining notable damage, like substantial loss of shingles or siding, which was NOT noted anywhere along the path.

Extensive damage occurred here to a barn, grain silo, trees, and a 19th century residence. The north end of the barn was destroyed and the grain silo was lifted and rolled approximately 150 yards to the northeast. A swirl pattern was evident as well in vegetation along the shore of a pond near where the grain silo fragment came to rest. The back room and associated roof of the 19th century residence was pulled from the main structure, along with the plumbing fixtures and a portion of the concrete sub-floor. The structure and contents of the room and barn were scattered to the northeast along a path approximately 50 yards wide. Several pine trees with trunks approximately 8-10 inches wide were also snapped near the residence. This damage and its dispersal pattern was consistent with 100 to 110 mph winds of an EF1 tornado.\nThe tornado next crossed County Road 33A between Kettlersville Road and Kohler Lane, damaging power poles along County Road 33A. Two barns and another outbuilding on a property just north of the road were also destroyed. Only small segments of the barns were still standing, suggesting 100 to 110 mph (EF1) winds along this portion of the track. The debris from these structures was scattered over a large area of the adjoining field to the north, northeast and east near the intersection of County Road 33A and Woodland Drive. The tornado likely didn't track directly over this entire area, but instead debris was probably lofted and thrown free of the circulation in many directions, before falling back to the ground nearby.\nAn absence of damage for approximately 150 yards to the east of the field suggests the tornado briefly lifted, then descended again to strike two more barns and the north side of a house. Both barns lost their roofs and at least half of their exterior walls. Some roof damage also occurred to the house. Debris from these structures was lofted and then dropped to the east in an adjacent field and on both sides of US Route 33.\nAs the tornado continued east-northeast, it left visible striations in field vegetation and destroyed an outbuilding just west of the County Road 33A overpass across US Route 33. A large portion of the outbuilding was lifted and carried approximately 150 yards to the area just west of the overpass and dropped on the road, where a semi truck crashed into it. The semi driver was injured in the crash. The degree and pattern of damage both here and at the adjacent property to the west are indicative of 100 to 110 mph winds of an EF1 tornado.\nNo further damage was noted on the north side of US Route 33 or east of the overpass, so dissipation of the tornado likely occurred at this point.", "F_scale": 1, "Wind": 110, "Source": "NWS Storm Survey", "State_1": "OH", "State_2": null, "State_3": null }, "geometry": { "type": "LineString", "coordinates": [ [ -84.259309, 40.55966 ], [ -84.259055946986877, 40.559723897425656 ], [ -84.258903643906336, 40.559763315188619 ], [ -84.257496517286739, 40.560388166199417 ], [ -84.256505389832995, 40.560891333622138 ], [ -84.254427176802523, 40.561867754386483 ], [ -84.25390134672179, 40.562080174921292 ], [ -84.252240195074222, 40.562691101459066 ], [ -84.250960935508004, 40.563143444717142 ], [ -84.250005702157608, 40.563505654576446 ], [ -84.249722109777025, 40.563601164151194 ], [ -84.249234002684346, 40.563694821674588 ], [ -84.248785162945381, 40.563708848440299 ], [ -84.248376157269917, 40.56363036903015 ], [ -84.247714982968859, 40.563656271439257 ], [ -84.247458842252485, 40.563728714598554 ], [ -84.246963041038356, 40.563848634021568 ], [ -84.246608028789154, 40.563978339782196 ], [ -84.246367923119209, 40.564095088983166 ], [ -84.246207821318052, 40.564115386925849 ], [ -84.24589177839934, 40.564117753882172 ], [ -84.245737265930615, 40.564144304491791 ], [ -84.245581586049042, 40.564179739220279 ], [ -84.245110578038833, 40.564270021630662 ], [ -84.244720829785905, 40.56432302552669 ], [ -84.24430584827914, 40.564394551333251 ], [ -84.24408120861753, 40.564439058773431 ], [ -84.24385902159392, 40.564485541548791 ], [ -84.243609515619568, 40.564491710862356 ], [ -84.243478125562063, 40.564474939838263 ], [ -84.24313502073764, 40.564502411060246 ], [ -84.241629535933129, 40.564568464182528 ], [ -84.241238213745049, 40.564590530241119 ], [ -84.240148538393072, 40.56469923491052 ], [ -84.239123536874644, 40.564787556886884 ], [ -84.23877702806621, 40.564835719535338 ], [ -84.238134629693917, 40.564950164178597 ], [ -84.237477156003109, 40.565144848548087 ], [ -84.23679937761753, 40.565350998895454 ], [ -84.236315426086179, 40.565506122544619 ], [ -84.235643781391076, 40.565684397010344 ] ] } },

The home also suffered some damage, including glass from a storm door blown in and broken glass from four windows. A circular item around three feet in diameter and weighing two hundred pounds was lifted up, hit the house and then deposited about a couple hundred feet in a ditch behind the house. Numerous trees and large limbs across the property were also knocked down. A few of the trees reached diameters up to two feet.\nDebris was evident in the field northeast of the East Mitchell Road residence. This debris was associated with the large metal building at the first location.\nAdditional damage was found further northeast at a residence on County Road 200 East. Several trees were downed, with one falling on the roof of a house and causing damage.

Winds in this area were estimated to be between 90 and 95 mph. Further east along Mayhew Road a large, well-built barn was uplifted and removed from its foundation with several cedar and maple trees twisted and snapped. Across a farmer's field, corn was flattened and twisted in multiple directions. Large, heavy fuel tanks were rolled in two different directions on Mayhew Road. Several barns and outbuilding had roof damage as well.\nAt the Mayhew and Pope Road intersection there was extensive softwood and hardwood tree damage, especially around the Harmony Missionary Baptist Church at 5226 Pope Road. Residents said there was a major pressure change with the tornado.\nThere were indications there may have been more than one tornado as tree positions would go from a tornadic circulation of northeasterly to southeasterly direction and then to all straight line wind damage in an easterly wind direction, then back to a tornadic circulation in multiple directions. Radar supports this ground analysis with mesovortices along the leading edge of the potent squall line. The width of the individual circulations varied between 75 and 125 yards with widespread straight line wind damage all around.

Here, the tornado did significant damage to a few metal sheds and downed numerous trees (including a few hardwoods), snapping and uprooting their trunks. The tornado then tracked northeast and crossed Bellevue Road and Highway 157 where the damage remained confined to trees. The tornado then paralleled, but remained just southeast of Cotton Valley Road, before it crossed International Paper Road, downing additional trees. The tornado then crossed over into Webster Parish. Although the higher tornadic winds were found in Central Webster Parish, estimated wind speeds from this EF-1 tornado throughout Bossier Parish consistently ranged from 90-100 mph. This is a continuation of the Bossier Parish EF-1 tornado. This tornado, with estimated maximum winds near 110 mph, tracked northeast across Fuller Road, with damage confined to trees as it moved over Bayou Dorcheat and over Dorcheat Road. The tornado then crossed Highway 371 and Couchwood Road, where additional trees were snapped and uprooted, with a portion of one tree responsible for minor damage to a shed off of Couchwood Road. The tornado then moved across heavily wooded areas in Central Webster Parish that was inaccessible by vehicle, but tornadic debris signatures from doppler radar remained consistent within the tight rotation in the favorable area of the storm to suggest that it remained on the ground where it crossed Mims Road, where several hundred hardwood and softwood trees were snapped and uprooted. The tornado continued to Evergreen School Road where two single family homes and their sheds were significantly damaged. A brick home lost most of its roof and as the roof was torn off, it toppled a brick wall. The damage to the brick wall was not rated up to an EF-2 as it occurred due to impacts from the removal of the roof and not the direct winds of the tornado. However, it was here where the tornado was strongest, with estimated maximum winds near 110 mph. The second home also had most of its roof torn off. The tornado then crossed Highway 159, where it picked up a single wide mobile home and carried it approximately 50 yards, with the undercarriage separating from the rest of the home and wrapping it around a tree. The rest of the mobile home was destroyed when it landed. Three other nearby mobile homes suffered minor damage to their roofs and/or carports. The tornado showed signs of weakening in the tree damage indicators after it crossed Angi Road and into Western Claiborne Parish. This is a continuation of the Webster Parish tornado. This EF-1 tornado, which had weakened as it entered Western Claiborne Parish, had estimated maximum winds near 90 mph, as it crossed Grigsby Loop and Flat Lick Road, where additional trees were snapped and uprooted.
