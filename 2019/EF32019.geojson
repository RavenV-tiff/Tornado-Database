Minor roof damage to a nearby two story home also occurred. As the tornado tracked northeast across the eastern side of downtown Columbus, MS, it became evident that the storm had grown in strength a bit as streets became littered with uprooted and snapped hardwood and softwood trees, many of which had fallen on homes, causing significant roof damage. As the tornado moved along 9th street and College Street, damage was noted on top of a cell tower, where portions of the metal structure was evidently bent. By the time the tornado reached 12th Street and 4th Avenue, more extensive damage was noted by way of a brick fence along a single family home getting almost completely destroyed and additional snapped and uprooted hardwood trees. Wooden power lines were snapped near or at its base at 12th Street and 4th Avenue, where portions of the roof was loss at the nearby Canterbury Townhouses. Littered downed and snapped trees falling on top of homes persisted along the northeast side of downtown Columbus, and southward facing homes along Railroad Street had windows that were blown out. As the tornado continued along its northeast path, it intersected the Hunt Intermediate School along 10th Avenue and 20th Street resulting in significant damage to the roof, and blown out windows along the second floor. Across the street, the Park and Rec Center and Activities Center composed of metal and tin were blown in/collapsed on its entry side. Damage continued along Tuscaloosa Road by way of fence damage along the outskirts of a Loves Truck Stop and snapped softwood and hardwood trees behind the Loves Truck Stop. The First Pentecostal Church along Tuscaloosa Road had half of its tin roof blown off, and thus resulted in damage done to the inside of its worship area. At the intersection of Tuscaloosa Road and Conway Road, several manufactured buildings had most of its exterior walls and roofs caved in. The one fatality occurred at the intersection of Tuscaloosa Road and Gardner Street, where a structural sound brick building collapsed and the majority of the exterior walls were destroyed. This tornado began to weaken as it neared the Alabama state line, as several softwood medium size tree limbs and snapped softwood trees occurred north of Highway 50. This tornado lifted just as it crossed state lines into Alabama.

This tornado initially touched down near the intersection of US-90 and Crump Road in eastern Leon County. Damage in this area was limited primarily to snapped trees. The tornado intensified after moving east of US-90 and destroyed an outbuilding on Wadesboro Rd just west of Baum Road. After crossing Baum Road, the tornado reached peak intensity in the vicinity of Steeds Run. In this area two homes were destroyed. Damage with both homes was consistent with a low-end EF-3 tornado. All exterior walls were collapsed and some of the debris was blown well off the foundation. Additionally, cars located near a home were lofted and moved from a parked position in front of the home. Maximum winds in this area were estimated at 140 mph. The tornado continued moving east and began to weaken. Even so, damage in far Eastern Leon County on Jefferson Rd South near Driftwood Circle was still significant with multiple power poles snapped and numerous trees snapped or uprooted. The tornado continued moving east and crossed into Jefferson County near Tradition Way. Numerous pine trees in this area were snapped between 6 and 10 feet above the ground.\nFrom a historical perspective, this is the second tornado rated F3 or EF3 in Leon County since 1945. Accordingly, this makes the March 3rd tornado the 2nd strongest tornado to affect Leon County since 1945. Damage cost was estimated. This is a continuation of the Leon county tornado. The Jefferson county portion of this tornado was rated EF2 due to significant tree damage in the area. The tornado continued moving east and crossed into Jefferson County near Tradition Way.

The tornado traveled east-northeastward, crossing the Brazos River and moving into Robertson County shortly after developing. This tornado is a continuation of the tornado that began in Milam County. After crossing the Brazos River, the tornado moved east-northeastward, crossing US Highway 6 approximately 4.5 miles north of Hearne. EF-1 damage was identified at one structure near this highway crossing, and considerable tree damage consistent with EF-1 intensity tornadic winds were observed along the highway right of way. The tornado then proceeded east-northeastward towards Franklin.\nThe most significant damage occurred in the city of Franklin. Within a two-block long corridor on the south side of Franklin, the team confirmed EF-3 intensity tornado damage at 2 residences. Peak wind speeds at these sites were estimated at 140 mph. A number of additional structures on the south side of Franklin exhibited EF-1 and EF-2 intensity damage.\nThe tornado continued from Franklin east-northeastward along US 79, crossing the Navasota River into far western Leon County. This tornado is a continuation from Milam and Robertson counties. After entering from eastern Robertson County, the tornado dissipated in extreme western Leon County, 4 miles south-southwest of Marquez.

The most severe damage occurred to a double wide trailer that was destroyed and thrown over 150 years from its original foundation. The one female occupant of the trailer was killed. The path width was as wide as a half mile in places. The tornado continued into Cherokee County and was on the ground for more than 40 miles. An EF-3 tornado with maximum estimated winds near 160 mph that originally touched down in Houston County about 9 miles northeast of Crockett crossed the Neches River into Southwest Cherokee County, where it snapped and uprooted thousands of trees along its path. The tornado paralleled Highway 21 before reaching the city of Alto, where it severely damaged or destroyed approximately 20 homes. Included along the damage path southwest of Alto was the Caddo Mounds Sate Historic Site building, which had its roof torn off, nearly all of its exterior walls removed, and was left to only a few interior rooms in the building. Several people were outside running to get inside for safety when the building was destroyed, resulting in one fatality and a number of serious injuries. Multiple cars in the parking lot were thrown 150 yards into trees and across Highway 21. The tornado then went on to lift and destroy a double wide mobile home, throwing it 50 yards. As the tornado continued along Highway 21, its most significant damage was at a single family home and the St. Thomas Chapel which saw their roofs and exterior walls collapsed. Winds were estimated at 150 mph at this point.\nAs the tornado neared Alto, it destroyed three homes along Highway 294 and Singletary Street, recording high end EF-3 damage as it wiped the lower level of a two story home off of its foundation and left the top story of the home 20 yards away from the foundation. This damage was reviewed by tornado damage experts from the National Weather Service (NWS) Southern Region Headquarters, NWS Norman, and the Warning Decision Training Division who all agreed it was high end EF-3 damage (with maximum estimated winds near 160 mph) based off how the home walls were separated from the bolts which anchored them to the foundation. Surrounding damage indicators also validated the EF-3 tornado determination.\nThe storm then went on to destroy several homes and mobile homes at nearby Alto Elementary School and Alto High School. It also snapped a metal power pole before crossing Highway 69, where it went on to snap and debark several trees in rural Cherokee County north of Alto before crossing FM 343 and into extreme Northwest Nacogdoches County. This is a continuation of the Cherokee County EF-3 tornado that tore through the Alto community. This tornado continued to track northeast across extreme Northwest Nacogdoches County, where numerous trees were snapped and uprooted along County Road 898 and FM 1648 as it approached the Sacul community. The tornado moved through the southeast sections of Sacul, where additional trees were snapped and uprooted, headstones were shifted off their foundations in a cemetery, a metal flag pole was bent at a 45 degree angle, and a tree fell on a home on Highway 204. The tornado continued northeast crossing County Road 988 and just east of County Road 991 near the Rusk County line, where numerous trees were snapped and uprooted, and a large section of a metal roof was torn off of a home, before crossing over into Southern Rusk County. The damage to the home here was the strongest in Northwest Nacogdoches County, with maximum estimated winds near 120 mph. This is a continuation of the Cherokee and Northwest Nacogdoches County tornado that tore through the Alto and Sacul communities. This tornado crossed County Roads 4265 and 4238 in extreme Southern Rusk County, where numerous trees were snapped and uprooted. The tornado continued northeast across the East Fork Angelina River, Highway 84, and County Road 4233, where it began to weaken as much of the damage over these areas consisted of snapped large limbs. The tornado finally lifted on County Road 4233 near the intersection of FM 2753. The maximum estimated winds in Southern Rusk County was near 105 mph primarily in the area of County Roads 4265 and 4238.", "F_scale": 3, "Wind": 160, "Source": "NWS Storm Survey", "State_1": "TX", "State_2": null, "State_3": null }, "geometry": { "type": "LineString", "coordinates": [ [ -95.2718, 31.428 ], [ -95.215761819000022, 31.491124668 ], [ -95.165721166000026, 31.579136356 ], [ -95.15485665729932, 31.588611397285092 ], [ -95.15201871624879, 31.592501247625876 ], [ -95.141315511117796, 31.598473798342127 ], [ -95.139528300303141, 31.601157086759883 ], [ -95.139190384808103, 31.606159569554109 ], [ -95.137755379702071, 31.608198230944652 ], [ -95.13023437062941, 31.614646823003966 ], [ -95.122164106617788, 31.618797338426191 ], [ -95.121092077965955, 31.619338416352946 ], [ -95.118152112390021, 31.621471685215909 ], [ -95.116582213590959, 31.622642005652267 ], [ -95.103155321131567, 31.63904845421024 ], [ -95.095319262395719, 31.646901567325074 ], [ -95.092946271102051, 31.649282757982689 ], [ -95.083572978775123, 31.658154279783446 ], [ -95.080317648748974, 31.661184274450022 ], [ -95.071615772943119, 31.666767676219422 ], [ -95.069609327863077, 31.669288330569941 ], [ -95.067483733098129, 31.676628683552224 ], [ -95.065630192558388, 31.678500612124878 ], [ -95.060790638129333, 31.68156886179753 ], [ -95.051900299887279, 31.68282289882012 ], [ -95.049533060441831, 31.686132424369532 ], [ -95.049190698812822, 31.687216133669097 ], [ -95.047120230893711, 31.693879016533572 ], [ -95.045200510571817, 31.695807386979538 ], [ -95.006061236064056, 31.729275983616787 ], [ -94.979023429255108, 31.751183469638306 ], [ -94.964906471471409, 31.761473026916462 ], [ -94.951729978124717, 31.77954888795324 ], [ -94.941582264999965, 31.793430109366852 ], [ -94.929143684606174, 31.808511284038502 ], [ -94.920051696400265, 31.817262288972813 ], [ -94.915636646251301, 31.823266451105553 ], [ -94.913456800083736, 31.827912163779217 ], [ -94.907490792374233, 31.852774736329991 ], [ -94.891469317178348, 31.873039376780469 ], [ -94.878237995009044, 31.89419474904247 ], [ -94.875729697446445, 31.896739405438382 ], [ -94.868145900468448, 31.901462909624058 ], [ -94.859499486784557, 31.905531761095006 ], [ -94.856938547000027, 31.909446236 ] ] } },

Many of these streets were impassable due to the significant number of trees snapped, twisted, and uprooted. Many more trees were downed on Highway 3012 before the tornado tracked northeast towards Westwood Drive. It uprooted a number of trees onto fraternity houses before it crossed the Kansas City Southern Railroad. The tornado crossed the railroad and bent or uprooted several large light poles on Louisiana Tech's softball, baseball, and neighboring athletic fields. It snapped a number of power poles as well. The tornado crossed Tech Drive and damaged a number of dormitories where it removed their metal roofs and blew out windows. It continued northeast where it uprooted more trees on Louisiana Tech's and Ruston High School's campuses. The estimated winds as the tornado tore through the western and northern sections of Louisiana Tech University ranged from 115-130 mph.

At least two other barns also lost nearly half of their metal roofing in the vicinity of Bunker Hill Road. Numerous trees in this area, with trunk diameters of 18 to 24 inches, were also snapped and blown down in various directions. This type of damage was consistent with wind speeds of up to 90 mph and associated with an EF1 tornado.\nThe next damage occurred to homes and adjacent outbuildings along Mud Pike Road, immediately southeast of the intersection with State Route 118. Two homes retained their main roof structure but many shingles were removed. Two outbuildings and a larger barn were destroyed, likely resulting from EF1 tornado winds of 100 to 110 mph. Additional damage occurred along Hellwarth Road, just south of the intersection with Fairground Road. Several homes and outbuildings were damaged, with the most serious being a home that lost much of its roof and some exterior walls. High-end EF2 tornado winds of 125 to 135 mph likely caused the worst damage at this location.\nThe tornado path continued generally along Fairground Road from just east of the intersection with Hellwarth Road to the western corporation limit of the city of Celina. Homes, outbuildings, trees and utility poles were damaged here, and a free-standing cellular communication tower was knocked down. At least two homes suffered partial roof loss and one home lost its entire roof. The cellular tower was a lattice structure at least 300 feet tall and two of the three support attachments at the ground were broken. A 50 to 100 yard swath of trees were snapped and uprooted in a forested area leading up to the western edge of Celina. The damage to the cellular tower and trees was indicative of EF2 tornado wind speeds of 125 to 135 mph.\nMore substantial damage was observed just inside the western corporation limit of the city of Celina, along Fairground Road. At least a dozen homes were severely damaged here, with roofs completely uplifted and removed, along with many exterior walls collapsed. One residence was completely lifted from its foundation, with interior walls largely intact, and dropped in an adjoining field approximately 70 yards to the north-northeast. This residence was anchored to a cinder block foundation, with the upper level or two of blocks breaking from the rest under the force of the wind. Significant mud spatter was also observed on what remained of these homes, especially on the north and northeast facing sides, implying a strongly rotating column of air in contact with a nearby muddy field. This type of damage was consistent with wind speeds up to 150 mph and associated with an EF3 tornado. In this area along Fairground Road, a vehicle was thrown into a house, killing a person inside of the house.\nSignificant damage continued into a cluster of homes near and northwest of the intersection of Fairground Road and Touvelle Street in Celina. At least two dozen of these homes had partial or complete roof failure and many exterior walls collapsed. Two residences on either side of Jill Avenue were missing large portions of their exterior walls, indicative of winds as high as 140 to 150 mph and associated with an EF3 tornado. Evidence of multiple vortices within the tornado was also evident in the debris pattern here. Several cars were displaced by the wind and uplift in this neighborhood. A thick layer of mud was also spattered on the east and northeast facing sides of these structures, largely opposite the direction of the incoming tornado.\nThe degree and extent of damage started to gradually lessen east-northeast from near Touvelle Street to U.S. 127. From there the tornado continued to track farther northeast to near the community of Neptune. An approximately 100 yard swath of trees were snapped and uprooted in a small forested area between U.S. 127 and Celina-Mendon Road, north of Myers Road. A garage roof was displaced off the main structure along Celina-Mendon Road, between State Route 197 and Howick Road, causing exterior walls to also collapse. This damage was likely the result of EF2 tornado winds of 115 to 125 mph.\nA garage was destroyed along State Route 197, just northeast of the intersection with Rice Road. A house farther northeast along Riley Road, just south of the intersection with State Route 197, suffered partial roof removal along with the collapse of a few exterior walls. Based on the damage, wind speeds here were estimated to be at the upper-end of the EF1 range, between 100 and 110 mph.

From here, the tornado traveled east, affecting West River Red Grove Road. Damage along these roads was generally limited to trees. The tornado crossed into Miami County at 2128EST along Hall Road, about 4 miles east of Pitsburg. The tornado continued to move east across Miami County, eventually ending at 2144EST, about 4 miles southwest of Troy. While the tornado produced low-end EF3 damage in Miami County, the maximum strength in Darke County was consistent with EF1 damage and the maximum tornado width was about 1200 yards. The tornado initially touched down in Darke County at 2125EST, about a mile southeast if Pitsburg. It moved east and entered Miami County at 2128EST along Hall Road, about a half mile northwest of Potsdam.\nAs the tornado entered Miami County, significant tree damage occurred on State Route 721 south of Laura. Structural damage began to occur near the intersection of Wright Road and Markley Road, with partial roof loss to an outbuilding. On Ditmer Road and South Shiloh Road, nearly every property sustained tree damage, some of which was significant.\nAs the tornado neared State Route 571, structural damage became much more severe. Several homes on State Route 571 between South Shiloh Road and South Range Line Road were rendered uninhabitable. Many homes had at least partial roof removal and some sustained complete roof removal. A few homes suffered the collapse of some exterior walls and while this was more common with garage walls, it also occurred on a few well-built walls away from garages. At one home, a lawn tractor was thrown out into the adjacent field to the northeast.\nDamage was very similar across the field on South Range Line Road. Two homes experienced complete roof removal, with one also having walls collapse on multiple sides of the second story of the home. Mud splatter on all sides of structures was significant, and one vehicle interior was largely covered in mud after the failure of the rear window. Another home lost a significant portion of the roof, as well as losing quite a bit of material from an interior wall after the winds had entered the structure. The rotating winds of the tornado were very obvious on this north-to-south oriented road. Along the northern portion of the tornado track, one home lost its entire roof and had it deposited hundreds of feet into the field to the west, opposite the direction of motion of the tornado. Along the southern portion of the tornado track, debris accumulated across the field, along a tree line over a quarter mile away to the east.\nThe width of this tornado was most evident as it passed east across Elleman Road. Damage was observed as far south as the intersection with State Route 571 and as far north as several spots along State Route 55. While the damage on State Route 55 was primarily to roofing material and trees, more significant structural damage continued to be observed a little farther south on Elleman Road.\nThe tornado maintained its intensity as it crossed State Route 48 about a mile and a half north of downtown West Milton. Tree damage was severe along this road, with canopy loss even to trees that remained standing. Many structures were heavily damaged or destroyed. The only known injury from this tornado occurred when a trailer home was flipped over. A well-built brick home suffered the collapse of large portions of the west-facing and south-facing walls, with near-complete roof removal. A garage adjacent to this property was flattened. A trailer home just to the south was completely destroyed, with the failure of nearly all exterior walls and even some interior walls. Debris from these homes and structures was carried about a half mile across the field, stopped only by the tree line from traveling farther.\nWidespread tree damage and moderate structural damage continued to be observed as the tornado moved east across Calumet Road, Kessler-Frederick Road, and Kessler Road. One home on Kessler Road lost its entire roof and a full-size camper was thrown and wedged against the garage.\nLess significant damage was observed after passing Kessler Road, where the tornado turned from the east to the southeast. Damage observed on Nashville Road south of West Kessler Cowlesville Road was limited to trees, and it is believed that the tornado dissipated somewhere in this vicinity.\nThis tornado was responsible for a lengthy swath of EF2 level damage, generally 120 to 130 mph, extending from State Route 571 to Kessler Road. However, damage to a few homes on State Route 571, South Range Line Road, and State Route 48, was notably more significant, with a combined degree of roof loss and exterior wall collapse that warranted an estimate of 140 mph winds, within the EF3 category.", "F_scale": 3, "Wind": 140, "Source": "NWS Storm Survey", "State_1": "OH", "State_2": null, "State_3": null }, "geometry": { "type": "LineString", "coordinates": [ [ -84.468283534000022, 39.975929044999987 ], [ -84.436869501999979, 39.974218916999973 ], [ -84.376393199, 39.986248095 ], [ -84.359742046, 39.989273143 ], [ -84.341717601000028, 39.989536183999974 ], [ -84.319281459000024, 39.986978065000017 ], [ -84.300570369000013, 39.985136684999986 ], [ -84.287867426999981, 39.981585313999972 ], [ -84.274598003, 39.975126606 ], [ -84.269619823000028, 39.971969377 ] ] } },

Damage to numerous trees and structures occurred in this area, including partial roof removal of several apartment complexes. This damage appeared to be caused by low-end EF2 winds. The tornado continued east into Greene County, before lifting about 5 miles north of Xenia at 2232EST. This tornado was rated as an EF3 based on damage that occurred in Greene County. The tornado first touched down in Riverside in far eastern Montgomery County at 2212EST before quickly moving into western Greene County at 2213EST. The tornado continued to move east across western and central Greene County before lifting along U.S. 68, about 5 miles north of Xenia.\nThere were two locations along the track of this tornado in the Beavercreek area where damage was indicative of EF3 intensity. The first was in the vicinity of I-675 and Grange Hall Road. Several homes along Rushton Drive had entire roofs lifted, as well as the collapse of several exterior walls with only interior walls left standing. Additional homes along Gardenview and Wendover Drives experienced high-end EF2 damage with windows shattered, garage doors collapsed and entire roof structures removed.\nAdditional EF3 damage occurred in Beavercreek near Anna Laura Lane. In this area, some buildings of an apartment complex had large sections of roofs removed and exterior walls on upper levels collapsed, leaving just interior walls standing.\nMost of the damage from near Grange Hall road eastward to businesses near North Fairfield Road was EF2 to EF1 type damage, where some concrete block businesses had partially collapsed walls and roof lift off.\nMuch of the tornado path occurred from roughly 0.5 miles north of Kemp Road to within 0.1 miles south of Kemp Road, within the limits of Beavercreek. As the tornado moved east-southeast into Beavercreek township, the damage became more consistent with EF0, to occasionally lower-end EF1, damage.

This tornado tracked toward the east-northeast, crossing I-35E and impacted numerous commercial structures between this freeway and Harry Hines Blvd.\nExtensive damage to many businesses and residences, consistent with EF-1 and EF-2 intensity wind speeds, occurred near the intersection of Harry Hines Blvd and Walnut Hill Lane. As the tornado moved eastward, roughly coincident with Walnut Hill Lane, several gas stations, large commercial buildings, and churches, and at least one multi-story apartment complex sustained significant roof and exterior wall damage. This path of strong EF-1 and EF-2 damage continued east-northeast along Walnut Hill Lane through the Marsh Lane and Midway Road corridors. East of Marsh Lane, the tornado impacted more single-family residences, though commercial structures were still adversely affected at times. Severe damage to large hardwood trees, consistent with EF-1 intensity winds, was observed throughout the damage path from Marsh Lane to US HWY 75.\nIntermittent EF-1 and EF-2 damage also occurred to a number of residences in this area. Many of these damaged homes were large and/or well-established structures that sustained either partial or total roof loss, accompanied by minor exterior wall damage. This damage was consistent with 110-125 mph tornado winds. Within one concentrated region of EF-2 damage along Northaven Road west of US HWY 75, a particular single-family home was surveyed with total roof loss, and multiple collapsed exterior walls. The survey team determined that this damage was consistent with low-end EF-3 intensity winds of approximately 140 mph. This was the only structure that was assigned an EF-3 rating for this tornado.\nThe tornado continued eastward, toward US HWY 75 and produced significant roof damage to several businesses near US HWY 75 including office low-rise buildings, a car dealership, and a Home Depot. Damage here was assigned an EF-2 intensity. The tornado crossed over the southern part of the Texas Instruments campus and then began to turn more northeastward and parallel Greenville Avenue. Tree and roof damage consistent with EF-1 occurred as it crossed I-635. Several glass windows were blown out at a mid-rise office building. The tornado crossed an apartment complex near Walnut Street and Greenville Avenue where dozens of units had sections of missing roof consistent with EF-1 damage of 95-110 mph. The tornado moved across the Cutters Point apartment complex where numerous units experienced significant roof loss consistent with 115 mph or EF-2 damage. Another low-rise office building saw numerous windows blown out on all sides. The tornado continued into the Richland Park, Lakes of Buckingham, Richland Meadows, and College Park residential subdivisions where widespread tree and roof damage consistent with 80-95 mph winds occurred. A few homes in this area saw complete or total roof loss where winds were estimated at 110 mph or EF-1. The tornado began to weaken and took a sharp turn to the north near Richardson Square where it tracked to the Huffhines Park areas. Mostly tree damage occurred here with winds estimated near 70 mph or EF-0. The track then turned to the east and became very narrow near Duck Creek with the tornado dissipating as it crossed Jupiter Rd.

The damage here supported a multi-vortex tornado as one very intense vortex occurred. A well built brick structure had the roof removed and one of the exterior walls collapsed. Six vehicles were thrown with two large vans thrown 40-60 yards into a pile. One hardwood tree was ripped out of the ground (with no root ball) and piled by the vans. It then crossed Mississippi Highway 589/Main Street snapping and uprooting multiple softwood trees and causing damage to the portion of a one-story home. It continued to snap the trunks and large branches of softwood trees when it moved northeast to Poplar Street. A large cluster of snapped softwood trees was clearly evident once it neared Mississippi Highway 42, and it continued to snap softwood trees when it crossed Mississippi Highway 42.

Through town, the tornado produced a continuous path of snapped and uprooted trees, broken tree limbs, and minor structural damage to homes and businesses. As it crossed North 16th Avenue, it produced more significant damage to several businesses and a hotel, including briefly lifting the roof of the Super 8, collapsing portions of a small strip mall and standalone office building, and causing damage to the exterior and roofing of the Piggly Wiggly. A semi-truck and flatbed trailer carrying automobiles were also overturned in this area. The tornado continued to damage or blow down trees as it passed through the neighborhoods and the warehouse district of downtown, with several trees falling onto and damaging homes and cars. The Nora Davis Magnet School sustained heavy roof damage and a nearby home lost its entire roof and carport as the tornado crossed Interstate 59 and moved east of Laurel. It was in this area that the most intense damage occurred and was rated at EF3. A few electrical transmission trusses were collapsed, and the Wade Services manufacturing plant took a direct hit and experienced a total collapse of its structures.
