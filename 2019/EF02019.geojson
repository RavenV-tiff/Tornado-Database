This area was inaccessible, and the tornado start point was based upon a NEXRAD tornado debris signature from the KBMX radar. The tornado navigated rough terrain across Ivy Branch and into the northwest portion of a subdivision along Reach Crest Road and Reach Crest Drive, where thin tree trunks were snapped and other trees were uprooted. One tree was uprooted and fell onto a sports utility vehicle, damaging the rear door and knocking out the window. A nearby residence suffered notable roof damage resulting in three holes that penetrated the ceiling sheet rock and causing water damage to portions of the second level.\nThe tornado continued northeast where limited uplift to a roof occurred and a wind turbine ventilator was torn off the roof and found over 20 feet away from the home. Across the street along a narrow drainage basin, the funneling of inflow winds likely caused wind speed acceleration that knocked over a heavy metal outdoor grill, tore a few downspouts from their wall anchoring, and downed some fencing by snapping the support posts and blowing the wood at least 10 feet. Further northeast a small portion of a covered drive suffered some uplift of sheathing at North Shelby Baptist Church, where a few trees were snapped or uprooted near the entrance of Belcher Drive. To the east of Highway 280, multiple trees were snapped or uprooted along a portion of Old Highway 280 road near Salser Lane. The tornado tracked north-northeast of this point through uninhabited and inaccessible areas and then reached the Highland Lakes Subdivision where it crossed Highland Lakes Drive and affected areas along Southledge Road. The majority of damage here was due to snapped or uprooted trees though some minor roof damage was noted to a home along Southledge Road. Further northeast along Southledge Road near Ledge Circle, a home lost some shingles and a portion of a backyard fence was downed due to the winds.\nThe tornado continued northeast and affected some areas along Highland Lakes Trail, Springhill Lane, Springhill Court, Mountain Trace, and Watersedge Circle. Nearly all of the damage in this area was to uprooted or snapped trees. One home did lose a window likely due to a falling tree. Further northeast the tornado produced tree damage on portions of Knollwood Drive, Watermill Circle, Highland Lakes Trail, Sandhurst Circle, Grove Park Parkway, and Grove Park Circle. Along Grove Park Parkway there was some roof damage to a home along with minor damage to two signs and one street light along the roadway.

The damage was primarily uprooted or topped trees. No injuries or fatalities were reported with this tornado.\nThe first evidence of damage was near Fox Mill Road and Pinecrest Road where several trees were downed at approximately 8:55 EDT (7:55 EST). Isolated tree damage from this point to near the USGS complex on Sunrise Valley Drive was noted, with several trees topped along Glade Drive near Rosedown Drive. After passing across the Dulles Toll Road (Virginia State Route 267), minor tree damage was noted between Sunset Hills Road and Baron Cameron Avenue. The tornado then tracked across Reston Hospital Center, with no visible signs of damage, but damage was noted just north of the hospital on Town Center Drive near Town Center Parkway, where a tree was topped, fencing blown down, and shingles blown off several townhouses.\nAfter crossing Baron Cameron Avenue, the tornado passed just east of Trader Joe's grocery store destroying an outdoor shed. Nearby, a tall, two-foot diameter tree crashed through the upper floor of a townhouse on Quietree Drive that led local officials to condemn the property. Several large trees were either uprooted or topped along Bennington Woods Road between Crosswind Drive and Reston Parkway. A large, 100-foot tall tree fell and smashed the front end of an unoccupied vehicle parked along Center Harbor Road, midway between Reston Parkway and North Village Road. Minor tree damage along a narrow path was noted in neighborhoods located between North Village Road and Reston Parkway between Center Harbor Road and Wiehle Avenue.

Shards of glass were blown for hundreds of yards, with many shards also piercing clean through the doors and walls of a nearby barn. A few metal support beams from the greenhouse were also tossed up to 200 yards from their original position, with a number of loose outdoor objects tossed about in a chaotic, yet circular manner often consistent with tornadic winds. Eyewitnesses working at the time reported seeing circulating winds and a possible condensation funnel as damage to the greenhouse was occurring. The tornado then passed over a barn, scattering shards of glass, flower planters, and support beams. Many of these objects were deposited on the other side of the barn into a nearby field. Several trees sustained damage to limbs and branches, but all were left upright. The tornado dissipated as it moved into a clearing beyond the wooded area.
