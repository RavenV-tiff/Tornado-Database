The tornado began near the Coosa River just southwest of downtown Wetumpka. It quickly intensified as it moved northeast into downtown Wetumpka. The extent of damage done to multiple structures in Wetumpka indicated a tornado with high-end EF2 wind speeds. The damage included: collapse/failure of exterior walls, significant damage to interior walls, roof failures, shifting of structures, and collapse of structures due to direct and indirect causes. Several vehicles were also tossed or rolled, with debris puncturing framing. Trees were also snapped and uprooted. The First Presbyterian Church was heavily damaged, but rescue/clean-up efforts precluded an accurate assessment of damage.\nThe tornado continued northeastward, crossed the Coosa River, and then paralleled State Route 170 as it continued to damage structures and snap and uproot trees. The tornado cycled as it moved northeast into the northern portions of the town of Eclectic, evident via a new radar TDS (tornado debris signature) and fluctuating degree of damage.

At this initial point, several trees were knocked down and a few outbuildings were damaged. The tornado tracked east and crossed County Road 97, snapping or uprooting numerous trees. A few mobile homes suffered damaged, and a few homes suffered some roof damage. The tornado then entered the Weedon Field Airport complex. This is where the most extensive damage occurred. Numerous trees around the complex were snapped and uprooted. One home suffered damage, several metal structure buildings were completely destroyed, and several airplanes were damaged or destroyed, and the Eufaula ASOS was destroyed. The tornado continued eastward and weakened slightly after crossing US Highway 431. The tornado damaged a few buildings and uprooted trees along Roseland Drive. The tornado then crossed the Chattahoochee River and into Georgia. A strong/cycling tornado crossed into Georgia along the Chattahoochee River, about 2-3 miles south of Lakepoint Resort State Park, causing considerable tree damage along State Hwy 39 in northern Quitman county. The tornado raced east with more trees snapped or uprooted along Hwy 27, just south of CR 10. Based on the surveyable damage (mainly trees), EF-0 to EF-1 damage was noted with max wind speeds estimated around 100 mph. The tornado appeared to briefly weaken near Hwy 27, but quickly re-intensified as it crossed the Quitman/Stewart county line.  Narrative\tA National Weather Service survey found that an EF2 tornado with maximum wind speeds of 125 mph and a maximum path width of 860 yards moved into Stewart County from Quitman County along Bladen Creek west of Bethel Church Road. The tornado crossed mainly forested areas with numerous large trees snapped or uprooted. The tornado moved east crossing Foreman Branch and Hodchodkee Creek before reaching Wesley Chapel Road, downing numerous trees along its path. As the tornado approached the intersection of John Logan Road and Philadelphia Road, it reached EF2 intensity destroying multiple large metal-framed barns and moving several large pieces of farming equipment, including a cotton picker. In addition, a single-family home had its entire roof and most exterior walls pulled apart. Inside, a family of two with 3 dogs survived the tornado in their hallway with no major injuries reported. Just east of John Logan Road, several campers were flipped over and destroyed. There were no reports of injuries with the campers. The tornado continued moving east crossing Highway 27 uprooting or snapping numerous trees. To the east, along County Road 145, hundreds of large trees were uprooted or snapped. As the tornado continued eastward, it began to weaken but still damaged numerous trees between County Road 148 and Goodwins Pond Road as it approached the Webster County line. A National Weather Service survey found that the EF2 tornado that moved across Stewart County weakened to EF0 by the time it moved into Webster County along the Ichawaynochaway Creek west of Highway 41. The tornado moved only a short distance into the county before dissipating near the intersection of Highway 41 and Goodwin Cutoff Road. Despite weakening, the tornado still managed to snap large tree branches and overturn a large agricultural irrigation system around this intersection.

Only a very small portion of the track occurred in Carlisle County. The tornado proceeded northeast, passing mostly over undeveloped wetlands along Mayfield Creek. The damage path started with spotty tree damage and minor shingle damage. As the tornado approached the Ballard County line, a wider and more definitive path of snapped and uprooted trees became evident. Peak winds in Carlisle County were estimated near 105 mph as it was entering Ballard County. This multi-county tornado crossed extreme southeast Ballard County on its way from Carlisle County to McCracken County. The tornado track passed just northwest and north of the community of Lovelaceville. The two primary structural damage areas were the crossing points along Highway 1837 west of Lovelaceville and Hamburg Road north of Lovelaceville. West of Lovelaceville on Highway 1837, there was major roof damage to a few structures, including a mobile home and a farm outbuilding. A well-defined path of broken and uprooted trees was also evident. As the tornado reached Hamburg Road, the first evidence of EF-2 damage became visible. A large portion of the exterior wall of a house collapsed, and there was significant roof damage to the house. A nearby farm outbuilding was demolished. A swath of snapped and uprooted trees crossed the area. Building debris was deposited well downwind of the damaged or destroyed structures. Four cows were killed. The tornado path widened quickly, reaching 300 yards shortly after exiting Carlisle County. Peak winds in Ballard County were estimated near 115 mph. The tornado then crossed into McCracken County, where the majority of the damage path was located. This multi-county tornado entered McCracken County from Ballard County near the community of Lovelaceville. The tornado tracked within a couple of miles either side of U.S. Highway 62 for most of its path in McCracken County. The tornado intermittently reached EF-2 intensity from the Ballard County line to about two miles southeast of Barkley Regional Airport. A total of 25 dwellings were damaged along the path in McCracken County. Five businesses were damaged, and 20 residences were damaged. The damage was categorized as minor for 14 of the residences, major for one, and five were destroyed. Major structural damage included partial loss of roofs or walls. Minor damage to homes included the loss of shingles. Dozens of barns, outbuildings, garages, or grain bins were destroyed. A church, located on U.S. Highway 62 near Highway 305, lost much of the roof structure as well as a large part of a second story exterior wall. This is where the tornado reached its maximum intensity, with estimated peak winds near 125 mph. A total of 40 pre-schoolers were inside a day care facility in the church, but none were directly injured. At least ten vehicles sustained damage in this area near the church. The only injury occurred on U.S. Highway 62 near the church, where a grain bin was blown on top of a pickup truck traveling eastbound. During the final few miles of its track, the tornado weakened as it moved through the western part of the city of Paducah. In the western part of Paducah, the tornado moved across U.S. Highway 60 and the city's main shopping mall. The tornado dissipated shortly after crossing Interstate 24 between exits 3 and 4. The roofs of the shopping mall and a nearby strip mall were damaged. Several businesses in the mall area and along Interstate 24 sustained minor damage, mostly to roofs. Windows were blown out of vehicles and buildings. A moving semi truck was lifted along Interstate 24 and was blown into the median in a jack-knife position. Along the entire track, dozens of utility poles were down, causing extensive power outages for nearly 10,000 customers. Hundreds of trees were snapped or uprooted.

The tornado initially produced widespread EF-1 damage with sporadic EF-2 damage noted on Weathers Road. Along the path to Weathers Road, numerous trees were either uprooted or snapped and mangled together, consistent with EF-1 damage. At Weathers Road, structural damage was noted as a single family home had its exterior walls collapsed. Several metal farm buildings were also completely destroyed and strewn about a field. Sheet metal was wrapped around a nearby tree. An RV was flipped over numerous times landing crushed in an open field. In addition, another home had the windows blown out with roof damage. It was in this area that EF-2 damage was determined. The tornado continued tracking east and crossed Edgemont Road just north of HWY 264/64, then crossing HWY 264/64 where numerous trees were downed and snapped. Generally EF-1 damage was noted here. The tornado then moved east into Zebulon along and near Highway 97 (West Gannon Avenue) where numerous trees snapped and uprooted. It continued east of Zebulon, crossing HWY 264/64 again, and going just north of the Five County Stadium. Generally EF-0 and EF-1 damage was noted here. The Tink's Place tornado continued into western Nash County and then crossed into Nash County, where damage was observed on Brantley Road. Most of the damage consisted of trees being snapped and uprooted, with structural damage to an open-air farm outhouse. Just east on Massey Road, one newly constructed home suffered roof damage, with roof trusses severely damaged. Shingles had not been completed on the home yet, therefore this damage was considered EF-1 level. Also on Massey Road, a modular home suffered roof and wall damage, while two farm outhouses were severely damaged. The tornado then tracked east along Nade Road causing more uprooted and snapped trees. A home along Nade Road also lost its chimney with a cinderblock outhouse suffering complete roof failure. Finally, the tornado began to weaken as it crossed the woods east of Hoyt Road, and it eventually lifted just east of Winters Road.", "F_scale": 2, "Wind": 115, "Source": "NWS Storm Survey", "State_1": "NC", "State_2": null, "State_3": null }, "geometry": { "type": "LineString", "coordinates": [ [ -78.4399, 35.8275 ], [ -78.438533459976043, 35.827010435923114 ], [ -78.435941508400447, 35.82665382389456 ], [ -78.430491142451956, 35.827113962671831 ], [ -78.427894991833909, 35.826861806386262 ], [ -78.425103655096336, 35.825946722817719 ], [ -78.4220476155283, 35.826506214388758 ], [ -78.415578244731023, 35.82648985780321 ], [ -78.404559601575329, 35.827366168550327 ], [ -78.401770612701966, 35.827322279508337 ], [ -78.39996469254811, 35.82682293763861 ], [ -78.398873245820596, 35.825991789982766 ], [ -78.397339480474784, 35.825408898932039 ], [ -78.393991785600974, 35.825504802805483 ], [ -78.384142531559064, 35.823400007500425 ], [ -78.375570210173919, 35.822642638869695 ], [ -78.372008396789624, 35.821772900000326 ], [ -78.370386293634965, 35.821680944468937 ], [ -78.36830678816159, 35.822051517022885 ], [ -78.366767155483558, 35.821502759177349 ], [ -78.366204681351974, 35.82089227321336 ], [ -78.364507100090577, 35.820371104402113 ], [ -78.360859903052642, 35.822451259996853 ], [ -78.35885795439799, 35.824409430087655 ], [ -78.357567077979638, 35.824837207035273 ], [ -78.34589540819843, 35.821544307922125 ], [ -78.3420062572809, 35.821087106827292 ], [ -78.320392346486642, 35.821272920465674 ], [ -78.314710157469108, 35.823235939312838 ], [ -78.312052334204509, 35.824579715435505 ], [ -78.310172835841968, 35.824283537627309 ], [ -78.304399403289153, 35.824951399988606 ], [ -78.29350939627011, 35.826996459099576 ], [ -78.285173329070403, 35.829211200992688 ], [ -78.282695005193546, 35.829367773546949 ], [ -78.277759613946273, 35.830827103401646 ], [ -78.276042940572097, 35.830774806379452 ], [ -78.272856260195567, 35.831514455783292 ], [ -78.267992282763316, 35.831737087979093 ], [ -78.250420460954501, 35.831690118122026 ], [ -78.246128948882415, 35.831220533638373 ], [ -78.242646025970771, 35.831478507663235 ], [ -78.237557778611972, 35.831164364176914 ], [ -78.23650655384381, 35.830763952746167 ], [ -78.223145926848247, 35.832189845792129 ], [ -78.217504056647613, 35.833230817630067 ], [ -78.216324123099639, 35.832860788735672 ], [ -78.209586585417583, 35.832351353890374 ], [ -78.201903159275844, 35.832054506926909 ], [ -78.194244588270976, 35.832403323552683 ], [ -78.187729778245284, 35.830976062393859 ], [ -78.177057387784316, 35.830751121915057 ], [ -78.171343239501311, 35.831156739438995 ], [ -78.164718540862395, 35.832699251766428 ], [ -78.164053889468505, 35.832589434399381 ], [ -78.159834819391563, 35.833468739814236 ], [ -78.157711687043502, 35.834160616560951 ], [ -78.156199412897422, 35.833903039279505 ], [ -78.155100124433829, 35.833124074093178 ], [ -78.146419631794288, 35.830800190041884 ], [ -78.137798713997199, 35.828880613609329 ] ] } },

This tornado removed the roofs from several homes and caused some of the outer walls to collapse. It blew out a wall of a large metal building at the Boys Ranch, destroyed several outbuildings and continued to damage trees as it crossed over Twin Buttes Reservoir. Then the tornado entered the Southland Subdivision, located about 5.5 miles southwest of San Angelo where the tornado broadened to nearly a mile wide as it weakened. It damaged shingles on many roofs and a chimney, it toppled fences, broke windows, uprooted some trees and broke many tree limbs across the Southland Subdivision. The tornado continued to cause similar damage as it moved northeast into the College Hills Subdivision. The tornado then began to decrease in width and increase in strength near Angelo State University (ASU). The tornado damaged roofs, broke a large church window, and destroyed a gasoline canopy, fences and trees near ASU. This tornado even tore HVAC Units from the MHMR Building near downtown San Angelo.

Minor tree damage continued toward the river in the vicinity of CR 400.\nThe tornado crossed the Tennessee River and laid down again on the Limestone County shore near Brigadoon Drive.", "F_scale": 2, "Wind": 135, "Source": "NWS Storm Survey", "State_1": "AL", "State_2": null, "State_3": null }, "geometry": { "type": "LineString", "coordinates": [ [ -87.412614123000026, 34.644478785 ], [ -87.406777637, 34.647373847999972 ], [ -87.382483826999987, 34.661999233000017 ], [ -87.343134938, 34.678835752 ], [ -87.309145985999976, 34.688095755 ], [ -87.268282741, 34.706156051999983 ], [ -87.234342839000021, 34.720052203000023 ], [ -87.200228224, 34.73299526400001 ], [ -87.178314682, 34.749031757000012 ], [ -87.164695193, 34.755817578 ], [ -87.147428, 34.764257848 ], [ -87.128300724999974, 34.773877917 ] ] } },

The tornado tracked northeast over mainly forested areas of Marengo County for several miles producing sporadic tree damage. The tornado widened and strengthened rapidly as it continued northeast toward Highway 80. The tornado reached its widest point near Highway 80. Substantial tree damage was noted on both the north and south sides of Highway 80 along and near the intersection of County Road 57. A home sustained roof damage along County Road 57. On the north side of Highway 80, property and structural damage was extensive. Several homes sustained roof and structural damage. One brick home sustained complete roof loss and partial wall collapse.\nJust east of that location, a single-wide and double-wide manufactured home on the same property were completely destroyed with the undercarriage of both blown a substantial distance. Inspection of both dwellings indicated little to no anchorage of the structures. Three people were reported injured at this location with one being airlifted for more serious injuries. Tree damage in this area was extensive with large old growth hardwoods snapped. The combination of the damage to the conventional brick home, along with the tree damage and manufactured home destruction, prompted the maximum wind rating of 120 mph.

Damage...consisting of snapped trees, destroyed outbuildings and damaged irrigation machinery...then continued along a widening path heading east-northeast toward the Mystic community. Damage was significant in Mystic. Several homes suffered serious roof loss and a couple brick buildings were nearly destroyed. Debris including concrete chunks was thrown hundreds of yards into a nearby field. There were hundreds of snapped and uprooted trees of all kinds in the area. Damage was well into the EF-2 range here with max winds estimated at 125 mph, and the damage path widened to near 400 yards. Continuous damage...mainly downed trees and damaged barns...persisted along a wide path as the tornado continued moving east-northeast. The next area of significant damage was noted in a neighborhood south of Fitzgerald, Georgia at the intersection of Vo Tech and Old Whitley Crossing Roads. More than a dozen homes suffered major roof damage here with several experiencing complete loss. A couple RVs were rolled over and heavily damaged. The tornado continued moving northeast eventually crossing into Ben Hill county along Highway 319. Several more homes suffered roof damage, many barns were destroyed and hundreds of trees were snapped. The last evidence of damage was to a barn and trees along Partridge Road approximately 2.5 miles east of the Ashton community.
