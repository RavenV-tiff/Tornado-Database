The tornado continued \nalong JB Shackelford Road in mostly rural open farm fields before \ndamage occurred along Johnson Young Road (Route 739).  Several trees \nhad large limbs down, and a hardwood tree was uprooted nearby.  The \nstrongest damage occurred as a nearby barn was completely demolished \nwith estimated wind speeds at 110 mph for strong EF-1 winds.  \n\nThe tornado then turned to the northeast causing minor damage to a \nporch covering at BL Shackelford Road.  Damage continued toward \nWilliams Store where significant tree damage occurred with several \nlarge trees either snapped or had large branches broken.  The \ntornado then crossed rural areas west of Nashville Road (Highway \n431).\n\nAt Nashville Road, a barn had roof damage observed with another \noutbuilding shifted off the foundation.  At this point, the tornado \nappeared to strengthen with consistent damage just north of Ellis \nRoad.  A barn had a silo completely destroyed with major damage to 2 \nother silos, and drone footage confirmed several trees uprooted with \nbranches snapped beyond this barn.  The tornado then did some damage \nalong Ellis road with roof damage observed at another barn.\n\nAn isolated tree snap occurred near the junction of Franklin Road \n(route 100) and Airport Road before the tornado crossed rural fields \nnear the Russellville-Logan County Airport.  The tornado continued \nto the northeast with damage observed to the west of Dennis Corinth \nRoad to trees and barns.\n\nThe National Weather Service would like to thank the Logan County \nEmergency Management for assistance with providing locations for the \ndamage survey from this tornadic storm.", "F_scale": 1, "Wind": 110, "Source": null, "State_1": "KY", "State_2": null, "State_3": null }, "geometry": { "type": "LineString", "coordinates": [ [ -86.969995034, 36.761099906 ], [ -86.931199563, 36.761374954 ], [ -86.903047097, 36.776226102 ], [ -86.866654886, 36.784475496 ], [ -86.842622293, 36.786950141 ], [ -86.8185897, 36.791899192 ], [ -86.789063943, 36.813066521 ] ] } },

The tornado then continued into the Woodhill subdivision where several homes sustained mostly roof damage. The tornado then continued downstream, crossing Hwy 289 and then following along Hwy 3211, Red Fern Rd. Several homes experienced damage here, again mostly with roof issues, but multiple trees were also uprooted and/or snapped.\nAdditional damage occurred along Palestine Rd and Sharp Ln, mostly roofing damage, but some of the debris falling downstream hit and broke off parts of a low brick wall. Two power poles in the area were bent roughly 30 degrees, with one cracked at the base but still standing.\nThe tornado caused its last damage along Old Spurlington Road near US Hwy 68. A two-story home had some roofing damage along the top ridge. A tree on the southwest side of the home surprisingly did not fall on the house, but a nearby air conditioner unit was pushed partly off its foundation. A little bit downstream, closer to Hwy 68, a large garage structure had significant roofing damage and a wall buckling outward.\nA house and barn were damaged just downstream of Hwy 68. An eyewitness reported seeing the tornado lifting in this area. A motorist said it crossed KY 744 in front of him, and it was not touching the ground right after it went through his area.\nSide note: this tornado track was parallel to and about 4 miles southeast of the EF-3 tornado that tracked through the region on December 11, 2021.", "F_scale": 1, "Wind": 110, "Source": "NWS Storm Survey", "State_1": "KY", "State_2": null, "State_3": null }, "geometry": { "type": "LineString", "coordinates": [ [ -85.385384644, 37.373418321 ], [ -85.373025025, 37.376692298 ], [ -85.368046845, 37.378806665 ], [ -85.350623215, 37.382080406 ], [ -85.342297639, 37.387127144 ], [ -85.33749112, 37.389173022 ], [ -85.33122548, 37.390946071 ], [ -85.322384919, 37.392719078 ], [ -85.315775956, 37.395583078 ], [ -85.31260022, 37.398651528 ], [ -85.281701173, 37.40724252 ], [ -85.277854885, 37.408806349 ] ] } },

This tornado damage path was embedded within a broader swath of straight line wind damage. Hundreds of trees were uprooted or snapped, and multiple outbuildings were destroyed, but damage to homes in the area was mainly limited to roof, siding, and window damage.\nThe tornado touched down a half mile west of Union City, initially snapping off multiple cedar trees. Homes along Noland Road sustained roof, siding, and window damage, some of which occurred as a result of flying debris from damaged outbuildings. Nearby, along Union City Road, straight line winds estimated at 80 mph shifted mobile homes off foundations and overturned a small shed.\nMore extensive damage was observed as the tornado approached Walker Parke Road, where multiple hardwood trees were uprooted or snapped. One home had its chimney collapse, and a brick from the chimney was thrown through the window of a van parked on the south side of the home. A neighboring home lost its entire metal roof.\nThe most extensive damage occurred east-northeast of Union City along Doylesville Road. Many cedar trees were snapped and the roof of a home was damaged at a farm in a valley area, but the winds strengthened as the tornado reached another farm near the next ridge top. Here, three substantial outbuildings were completely destroyed, and one was shifted far enough off its foundation to be a total loss. Many trees were uprooted or snapped on this property, and the home sustained damage to its roof and gutters.
