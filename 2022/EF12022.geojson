Damage continued toward \nWilliams Store where significant tree damage occurred with several \nlarge trees either snapped or had large branches broken.  The \ntornado then crossed rural areas west of Nashville Road (Highway \n431).\n\nAt Nashville Road, a barn had roof damage observed with another \noutbuilding shifted off the foundation.  At this point, the tornado \nappeared to strengthen with consistent damage just north of Ellis \nRoad.  A barn had a silo completely destroyed with major damage to 2 \nother silos, and drone footage confirmed several trees uprooted with \nbranches snapped beyond this barn.  The tornado then did some damage \nalong Ellis road with roof damage observed at another barn.\n\nAn isolated tree snap occurred near the junction of Franklin Road \n(route 100) and Airport Road before the tornado crossed rural fields \nnear the Russellville-Logan County Airport.

The tornado then continued downstream, crossing Hwy 289 and then following along Hwy 3211, Red Fern Rd. Several homes experienced damage here, again mostly with roof issues, but multiple trees were also uprooted and/or snapped.\nAdditional damage occurred along Palestine Rd and Sharp Ln, mostly roofing damage, but some of the debris falling downstream hit and broke off parts of a low brick wall. Two power poles in the area were bent roughly 30 degrees, with one cracked at the base but still standing.\nThe tornado caused its last damage along Old Spurlington Road near US Hwy 68. A two-story home had some roofing damage along the top ridge. A tree on the southwest side of the home surprisingly did not fall on the house, but a nearby air conditioner unit was pushed partly off its foundation.

Homes along Noland Road sustained roof, siding, and window damage, some of which occurred as a result of flying debris from damaged outbuildings. Nearby, along Union City Road, straight line winds estimated at 80 mph shifted mobile homes off foundations and overturned a small shed.\nMore extensive damage was observed as the tornado approached Walker Parke Road, where multiple hardwood trees were uprooted or snapped. One home had its chimney collapse, and a brick from the chimney was thrown through the window of a van parked on the south side of the home. A neighboring home lost its entire metal roof.\nThe most extensive damage occurred east-northeast of Union City along Doylesville Road.

A concentrated \narea of intense straight line winds developed in the Okolona area, \nwith the National Weather Service office anemometer measuring 72 \nmph. A more concentrated area of straight line winds occurred off \nBeulah Church Rd, south of I-265. Vast majority of the wind damage \nwas facing to the east northeast but there were a few trees that \nwere on few other directions. However read our imagery, would \nindicate more straight line winds, and just east of there towards \nthe Bardstown Woods subdivision everything was facing to the east \nnortheast. Winds were estimated to be 75 mph. \n\nStraight line winds changed to a tornado right at the edge of \nBardstown Woods subdivision and the south side of Fairmount Road. \nDrone video showing a distinct swirl in the trees from the north \nthrough the southeasterly directions. Trees were snapped, uprooted, \nand laying on top of power lines. Winds were around 90 mph in this \narea, with a width of 150 yards. \n\nThere was extensive shingle damage, gutter damage, flashing, at \nseveral homes. The tornado increased in width and speed, in the \nGlenmary Reserves subdivision, especially along Providence Road.  \nThere was more extensive damage to the roofing structures of several \nhomes. One house in particular had wind enter its roof soffit, \nblowing building material out the western side. The house \ninsulation was thrown around three sides of the home. Wind speeds \nin this area were estimated to be 97 mph with a width of 125 yards.  \n\nA Ford Ranger, parked in another driveway was picked up and slid 11 \nyards, with house insulation on three sides of the truck. There were \nseveral road signs twisted and mangled too. The tornado continued \ntowards the entrance of the Glenmary Reserves subdivision off \nBardstown Road. There was extensive tree damage, especially cedars \nand pines, facing from the north-northeast, through the \nsoutheasterly direction. Trees were uprooted, snapped, and slightly \nsheared off. The 88-D radar showed a distinct debris ball in the area \nwe found the tornado. \n\nThe tornado crossed Bardstown Road striking at least two vehicles, \nthankfully there were no injuries. The tornado continued in the \nGlenmary subdivision with noticeably less and more sporadic damage. \nMost of the damage to the homes was related to shingle, flashing, \nand siding.  However, one home in particular had the 85-90 mph wind \nget in through the attached garage. This caused a massive structural \nfailure in the roofing structure, with roof decking and insulation \nthrown up into the trees from a northerly to a southeasterly \ndirection. Insulation was thrown around three sides of the house. \nThe owner of the house described intense ear pressure when the \ntornado went over his house. \n\nThe tornado weakened by the far eastern part of the Glenmary \nsubdivision lifted at that point. Wind speeds, along the sporadic \ntree damage, at the end point were 75 mph. \n\nThe survey crew continued eastward and went along Broad Run Road \nwith intermittent fallen trees.  Next, the crew went into the \nParkland‘s of Floyd’s Fork Turkey Run park.

The first damage noted was along Barterbrook Road one-half mile north of Tinkling Spring Road where there were broken tree branches and both hardwood and softwood trees were snapped. As the tornado progressed east, additional trees were snapped and uprooted along with significant damage to a farm on the 1100 block of Tinkling Spring Road. At this farm, significant roof and structural damage was observed to a barn. A farmhouse lost portions of its metal roof which became dislodged and were wrapped around branches of a tree. Lumber from the barn was lofted approximately 125 yards and embedded into the ground in different directions. Trees on the farm were noted to be snapped in multiple directions. The tornado continued eastward towards the intersection of Tinkling Spring Road and Ramsey Road where more hardwood tree branches and entire softwood trees were snapped. Some screens were also damaged on homes and some siding was dislodged at this location. The tornado crossed Tinkling Spring Road where additional hardwood trees were uprooted and softwood trees were snapped. Siding and roof damage occurred to a mobile home and two 75-yard sections of fence were blown inward at a plumbing supply facility. A trash dumpster and grease dumpster were flipped sideways, and minor structural damage was observed to an office complex near the intersection of Tinkling Spring Road and Ivy Ridge Road. Sporadic damage continued near Ivy Ridge road. As the tornado moved east through Ivy Ridge, the tornado produced scattered tree and structural damage throughout the area. The tornado then paralleled Ladd Road and crossed Interstate 64 near Hickory Hill Road. The tornado continued moving east into a wooded area between Hickory Hill Road and Lew Dewitt Boulevard. The survey team noted scattered uprooted and snapped trees. The tornado then entered the City of Waynesboro and crossed Lew Dewitt Boulevard near Bookerdale Road. Hardwood trees were snapped in this area. The tornado then continued moving east into a wooded area resulting in additional scattered tree damage. As the tornado continued trekking east, hardwood trees were uprooted and additional minor branch damage occurred in a residential area in the City of Waynesboro near Sterling Drive and Parker Heights Road near the water tower. Several trees were brought down onto residential structures and a steeple was blown off of a church. The tornado dissipated near Wayneridge Road, but not before causing a large tree to fall onto a residence causing considerable damage on Bader Avenue.

The tornado touched down at approximately 2:11 PM EDT near the intersection of Maple Shade Road and Kirkwood Pike in Kirkwood, PA and traveled towards the northeast for approximately 3.1 miles before dissipating near Rynear Rd in Christiana, PA at approximately 2:16 PM EDT. The tornado destroyed several large barns and outbuildings and caused three minor injuries. The tornado touched down as an EF-0 tornado on the 400 block of Maple Shade Rd, where it uprooted 2 large hardwood trees and 1 large softwood tree at a private residence. The tornado moved ENE and downed several large tree limbs and did minor siding damage to a building at the corner of Maple Shade Rd and Kirkwood Pike. A crop field behind the post office on the north side of Kirkwood Pike showed a clear pattern of convergence within the crops blown down by the tornado as it continued moving towards the NE. The tornado then destroyed a small shed constructed with cinderblock walls, carrying contents from inside the shed toward the NNE. Large limbs from trees to the southeast of the shed were knocked down and facing the NW, towards the centerline of the tornado track. A second small shed behind property on the 300 block of Maple Shade Rd was destroyed, with debris carried over 200 yards toward the N and NE. The tornado intensified to EF-1 strength as it moved northeast and caused near complete destruction of a large barn on a property on Farmdale Rd. Three of the barn s 4 walls were removed, as well as all of the roof, with debris carried more than 200 yards toward the NE. A second large barn was partially destroyed, with one wall completely removed, two walls partially removed, and half of the roof removed. There was one minor injury of scratches due to flying debris. Two large hardwood trees were downed on the property, pointing North toward the centerline of the tornado track. The tornado continued moving northeast, putting a dent into the southeast side of one large silo before causing crop damage in a large field. The pattern of crop damage was strongly convergent, with crops on the right periphery of the tornado track laying towards the NNW and crops on the left periphery of the tornado track laying towards the ESE. The tornado crossed over E Salem Rd near Ridge Rd, where it downed several large trees and snapped several others. Several more trees were uprooted farther north along Ridge Rd. The tornado then approached Rosedale Rd, uprooting and snapping a couple dozen trees on a private residence near Coopers Run. After crossing Rosedale Rd, the tornado then destroyed two barns and a shed. Wooden beams from one of the barns were carried by the tornado as projectiles and penetrated through the NW facing wall of another barn on the property. A house on the property was also damaged, with some siding dented, broken, or removed, and the partial collapse of a basement wall on the NW facing side of the house. The collapse of the basement wall caused minor cuts and scratches to at least two people taking shelter in the basement. The top of a farm silo was also removed. The tornado continued to produce significant damage as it hit another farm on Highland Rd. Two barns had their roofs completely removed. A third barn lost about half of its roof. A fourth structure, which appeared to be a shed without walls, collapsed. Two silos were also damaged, including the removal of the top of one of the silos. The intensity of the tornado decreased to EF-0 as it approached one more farm on Rynear Rd near Bells Run. The tornado partially removed the roof from one barn on the property. The tornado then moved northeast across Rynear Rd and downed a few tree limbs along Bells Run.", "F_scale": 1, "Wind": 105, "Source": null, "State_1": "PA", "State_2": null, "State_3": null }, "geometry": { "type": "LineString", "coordinates": [ [ -76.079668645, 39.855208569 ], [ -76.074572448, 39.860415514 ], [ -76.072008256, 39.863421421 ], [ -76.071740035, 39.863948471 ], [ -76.071396713, 39.864508457 ], [ -76.070280914, 39.865480186 ], [ -76.069615726, 39.866532364 ], [ -76.068671588, 39.867569942 ], [ -76.062041167, 39.876084076 ], [ -76.059466247, 39.877714321 ], [ -76.054337863, 39.882407236 ], [ -76.046344881, 39.889906999 ], [ -76.045915727, 39.891026542 ] ] } },

A path of enhanced damage from west of Dry Bone Road to east of Grassy Fork Road is noted in the aerial imagery indicative of this weak tornado. This corridor of damage is embedded within a much larger field of wind damage affecting large swaths of Pike County in general. The more concentrated corridor of damage does have a convergent nature to the felled trees, rather defined lateral bounds, and episodes of debris thrown upwind. Most notably, a garage which was heavily damaged on Grassy Fork Road has some of its debris thrown upwind of storm motion. Several corridors of extensive tree damage between Grassy Fork Road and State Route 124 have a clear convergent pattern in the felled trees. Damage in these areas is consistent with wind speeds around 90 mph. The tornado likely lifted in the hills east of Grassy Fork Road, but the line of storms and significant storm outflow continued to produce widespread straight line wind damage in excess of 70 mph across much of Pike County, including some localized areas possibly approaching 80 mph.
