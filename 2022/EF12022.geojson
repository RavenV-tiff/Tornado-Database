After a gap of more than 2 miles, the \ntornado redeveloped and caused damage along Watermelon Road.  Minor \nroof damage occurred near this location.  The tornado continued \nalong JB Shackelford Road in mostly rural open farm fields before \ndamage occurred along Johnson Young Road (Route 739).  Several trees \nhad large limbs down, and a hardwood tree was uprooted nearby.  The \nstrongest damage occurred as a nearby barn was completely demolished \nwith estimated wind speeds at 110 mph for strong EF-1 winds.  \n\nThe tornado then turned to the northeast causing minor damage to a \nporch covering at BL Shackelford Road.  Damage continued toward \nWilliams Store where significant tree damage occurred with several \nlarge trees either snapped or had large branches broken.  The \ntornado then crossed rural areas west of Nashville Road (Highway \n431).\n\nAt Nashville Road, a barn had roof damage observed with another \noutbuilding shifted off the foundation.  At this point, the tornado \nappeared to strengthen with consistent damage just north of Ellis \nRoad.  A barn had a silo completely destroyed with major damage to 2 \nother silos, and drone footage confirmed several trees uprooted with \nbranches snapped beyond this barn.  The tornado then did some damage \nalong Ellis road with roof damage observed at another barn.\n\nAn isolated tree snap occurred near the junction of Franklin Road \n(route 100) and Airport Road before the tornado crossed rural fields \nnear the Russellville-Logan County Airport.  The tornado continued \nto the northeast with damage observed to the west of Dennis Corinth \nRoad to trees and barns.\n\nThe National Weather Service would like to thank the Logan County \nEmergency Management for assistance with providing locations for the \ndamage survey from this tornadic storm.", "F_scale": 1, "Wind": 110, "Source": null, "State_1": "KY", "State_2": null, "State_3": null }, "geometry": { "type": "LineString", "coordinates": [ [ -86.969995034, 36.761099906 ], [ -86.931199563, 36.761374954 ], [ -86.903047097, 36.776226102 ], [ -86.866654886, 36.784475496 ], [ -86.842622293, 36.786950141 ], [ -86.8185897, 36.791899192 ], [ -86.789063943, 36.813066521 ] ] } },

The \ntiming for this tornado was based on eyewitness accounts. Several \npeople commented (and video confirmed) how they saw the persistent \nlow cloud base and then the tornado spun up real quick on the tail \nend of this long line of low clouds.  \n\nThe first evidence of touchdown was on Salem Church Road, where \nseveral outbuildings had damage. The tornado then continued into the \nWoodhill subdivision where several homes sustained mostly roof \ndamage. \n\nThe tornado then continued downstream, crossing Hwy 289 and then \nfollowing along Hwy 3211, Red Fern Rd. Several homes experienced \ndamage here, again mostly with roof issues but also multiple trees \nuprooted and/or snapped. \n\nAdditional damage occurred along Palestine Rd and Sharp Ln...where a \nhomeowner saw the storm coming, though he was unsure if it was just \nwind or a tornado coming at him. He and his wife went to the \nbasement of the home and the damage occurred about 2 minutes later.\nMostly roof damage but some of the debris falling downstream hit and \nbroke off parts of a low brick wall. Two power poles in the area \nwere bent roughly 30 degrees, with one cracked at the base, but \nstill standing. \n\nThe tornado caused its last damage along Old Spurlington Road near \nUS Hwy 68. A two-story home had some roof damage along the top \nridge. A tree on the southwest side of the home surprisingly did not \nfall on the house, but a nearby air conditioner unit was pushed \npartly off its foundation. A little downstream, closer to Hwy 68, a \nlarge garage structure had significant roofing damage and a wall \nbuckling outward. \n\nA house and barn were damaged just downstream of Hwy 68. An \neyewitness reported seeing the tornado lifting in this area. A \nmotorist said it crossed KY 744 in front of him, and it was not \ntouching the ground right after it went through his area.\n\nThe National Weather Service would like to thank the Taylor County \nEmergency Management and the Judge Executive for escorting us \nthrough the heaviest hit areas of Taylor County on a Sunday and in \nthe cold rain, with some sleet mixing in.\n\nSide note: This tornado track was parallel to and about 4 miles \nsoutheast of the EF-3 tornado that tracked through the region on \nDecember 11, 2021.", "F_scale": 1, "Wind": 110, "Source": null, "State_1": "KY", "State_2": null, "State_3": null }, "geometry": { "type": "LineString", "coordinates": [ [ -85.385384644, 37.373418321 ], [ -85.373025025, 37.376692298 ], [ -85.368046845, 37.378806665 ], [ -85.350623215, 37.382080406 ], [ -85.342297639, 37.387127144 ], [ -85.33749112, 37.389173022 ], [ -85.33122548, 37.390946071 ], [ -85.322384919, 37.392719078 ], [ -85.315775956, 37.395583078 ], [ -85.31260022, 37.398651528 ], [ -85.281701173, 37.40724252 ], [ -85.277854885, 37.408806349 ] ] } },

Nearby, along Union \nCity Road, straightline winds estimated at 80 mph shifted mobile \nhomes off foundations and overturned a small shed. More extensive \ndamage was observed as the tornado approached Walker Parke Road, \nwhere multiple hardwood trees were uprooted or snapped. One home had \nits chimney collapse, and a brick from the chimney was thrown \nthrough the window of a van parked on the south side of the home. A \nneighboring home lost its entire metal roof.  \n\nThe most extensive damage occurred east-northeast of Union City \nalong Doylesville Road. Many cedar trees were snapped and the roof \nof a home was damaged at a farm in a valley area, but the winds \nstrengthened as the tornado reached another farm near the next ridge \ntop. Here, three substantial outbuildings were completely destroyed, \nand one was shifted far enough off its foundation to be a total \nloss. Many trees were uprooted or snapped on this property, and the \nhome sustained damage to its roof and gutters.
