Radar data \nsuggests the starting point could have been slightly farther \nsouthwest than what is indicated in the survey and the ending \npoint could have been slightly farther northeast than what is \nindicated in the survey. In both cases the available public \nroad network limited access to achieve full precision. \n\nAlthough this tornado was in a rural portion of Sabine \nParish, the impressive maximum width of approximately half a mile\nallowed many residences and structures to be affected. \nApproximately 30 homes were damaged and approximately 10 to 15 \nwere heavily damaged, destroyed, or rendered unlivable. The \nsurvey suggested the tornado was most intense in a narrower \ncorridor from Highway 118 to where it crossed McInnis Road. In\nthis corridor damage indicators on several structures were at \nan EF2 level. The peak wind speed of 125 mph was associated\nwith a completely destroyed mobile home which had its remnants \nblown approximately 60 feet and piled up against a tree line. All\nof a family of 5 in the mobile home at the time of the tornado \nwere injured, with a few receiving critical injuries. Another \ninjury occurred farther downstream from this area, but this \ninjury was not critical. In addition to damage to residences, \nthere were scores of farm and outbuildings which were generally\ndestroyed and the survey team documented casualties of at least\ntwo horses. \n\nThis tornado was quite anomalous for its above average width in \nrelation to its relatively short path length. There were a few\nEF2 damage points associated with extreme swaths of tree damage, \nalthough little debarking was seen.

The first damage produced was along CR 69, and was limited\nto trees damaging homes.  Tree damage continued as the tornado\nmoved off to the north-northeast, crossing Al HWY 43 before\nmoving over inaccessible land between HWY 43 and the Black\nWarrior River.  The tornado crossed into Hale County at\napproximately 1:53 PM and intensified, uprooting and mowing down \nhundreds of trees as it moved along Bass Lane near the Black\nWarrior.  The tornado then moved along Mason Bend Road on a\nslightly diagonal angle uprooting and snapping numerous hardwood\nand softwood trees, damaging or destroying several manufactured\nhomes, and causing a few minor injuries.  One unoccupied single-\nwide manufactured home rolled over and landed upside-down on top\nof a car.  From there it continued east-northeastward, crossing\nErie Rd and CR 92 with slightly less intense damage to trees.  As\nit approached AL HWY 14 just north of Sawyerville, several homes\nwere damaged, and one double-wide was destroyed, causing several\ninjuries.  The tornado turned over a fish truck causing the load\nof fish to be  across the road, and deposited two pickup trucks\nin a pond.  The tornado continued east-northeastward snapping and\nuprooting trees as it crossed CR 17.  As it approached CR 30, the\ntornado reached its maximum intensity of about 135 mph.  A double-\nwide manufactured home was torn from it's anchors, lofted and\ntossed approximately 50 yards across the road, causing one\nfatality and 2 serious injuries.  A site-built home diagonally\nacross the street sustained significant roof damage and broken\nglass.  A double-wide home a few hundred yards south of the first\nhome was split in two, with one half of the home remaining\nanchored while the other half appeared to roll away.  The tornado\nthen crossed wooded land and pastures on either side of Big Brush\nCreek, before crossing CR 21, snapping and uprooting numerous\ntrees along the road.  Similar but less consistent damage\ncontinued as it crossed Raspberry and Hubbard Roads before moving\nover inaccessible woods and pastures along Five Mile Creek.  The\ntornado continued to weaken as it crossed AL HWY 69 near Harper\nHill, causing only sporadic tree damage.

Touchdown \nwas found near the Silverstone subdivision with weak EF0\ndamage...shingles off roofs and fences blown down. The\ntornado quickly strengthened to EF1 as it continued to cross a  \nresidential area and business park where a section of roof was \nlifted off a warehouse building and tipped over several empty \nsemi-trailers. Several trees were snapped and air conditioning units\nwere blown off the roofs of several buildings. The tornado crossed \nthe I-35/I-45 intersection and entered a large retail shopping \ncenter where roof and window damage was observed to several businesses.\n\nStill an EF1, the tornado crossed Dell Way and entered \nthe Windy Terrace and Greenlawn Place neighborhoods.  Widespread\ntree and roof damage was observed to multiple homes, a few lost their\nentire roof indicating the tornado had strengthened briefly to EF2.\nThe tornado likely weakened a bit before regaining EF2 strength as\nit moved northeast and crossed Gattis School road where substantial\nroof damage was shown on some homes near the intersection of Gattis\nSchool Road and windy Park Drive.  The Clay Madsen Rec Center and \nthe adjacent playing fields sustained damage as well.  It crossed \nA.W.Grimes Blvd. and entered the South Creek neighborhood where tree\nand roof damage was once again observed across many streets until it\nexited the neighborhood at Brushy Creek.  Before crossing Highway 79\nthe tornado made slight right turn and started to parallel the \nsouth side of Highway 79 and moved through the parking lot of the \nKalahari Resort where multiple vehicles were damaged, trees blown\ndown, and some windows of the resort were broken from flying debris.\nThe tornado was likely at high end EF1 strength when it followed \nBrushy Creek into the Forest Bluff neighborhood off Red Bud Lane. \nTrees were blown down along the creek and several homes sustained\nroof damage where large sections of roof were blown off the house. \nThe tornado crossed Red Bud Lane and damaged a few businesses at the \nRed Bud Lane and CR123 intersection.  \n\nShortly after crossing Highway 79 east of Red Bud Ln, the tornado\nproduced EF1 damage to an industrial park complex to numerous metal\nwarehouse buildings. The tornado then weakened and continued to the\nnortheast for nearly 5 miles producing minor EF0 damage to\nresidential roofs, trees, and signs. Several homes under construction\nwith only visible studs off of FM1660 collapsed. As the tornado\napproached Chandler Road near the intersection with CR 101, the\nintensity of the tornado increased again with EF1 damage observed to\na large metal building system with sections of the roof peeled away.\nAdditional EF1 damage was observed to a stable on a property near the\nSan Gabriel River with substantial tree damage as well. As the\ntornado neared CR337, EF2 damage was observed to a home on piers as\nthe roof, most exterior walls, and some interior walls failed and\nwere moved away from the property. EF1 damage then continued as the\ntornado affected more homes and metal system buildings as the tornado\ncrossed Highway 95 and CR345. Significant EF2 damage occurred to a\nresidential home near the intersection of CR347 and CR346. The\ntornado then produced EF1 damage to trees, power poles, and a few\nstructures as it crossed CR348, FM971, CR352, and CR357 before\nexiting Williamson County and entering Bell County.\n\nThe maximum width of the tornado and its damage path was roughly 500 \nyards with maximum winds at 135 mph, the high end of EF2. Most of the\n29 mile long track however was at EF1 strength. There are reports of \na total of 16 injuries, most of which were minor.
