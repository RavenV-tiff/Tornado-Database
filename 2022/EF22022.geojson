Many trees were uprooted and several were snapped. The roof and a small part of a wall were removed on a brick home. Several businesses sustained minor to moderate roof damage, and a few sustained major damage. A gas station canopy was destroyed, along with gas pumps.

Radar data suggests that the starting point could have been slightly farther southwest than what is indicated in the survey and the ending point could have been slightly farther northeast than what was indicated. However, limited public road access prevented a more accurate starting and ending point.\nThe maximum width of this tornado was approximately a half a mile, which allowed many residences and structures to be affected. Approximately 30 homes were damaged, with 10-15 homes either heavily damaged, destroyed, or rendered unlivable. The survey suggested that the tornado was most intense in a narrower corridor from Highway 118 where it crossed McInnis Road, where damage indicators of several structures suggested EF-2 winds. The peak wind speed of 125 mph was associated with a completely destroyed mobile home which had its remnants blown approximately 60 feet and piled up against a tree line. A family of 5 inside the mobile home were all injured, with a couple receiving critical injuries. Another injury occurred farther downstream from this area but this injury was not critical. In addition to damage to residences, there were scores of farms and outbuildings which were generally destroyed, with casualties of at least two horses.\nThis tornado was quite anomalous for its above average width in relation to its relatively short path length. There were a few EF-2 damage points associated with extreme swaths of tree damage, although little tree debarking was seen. It is estimated that at least 1000 trees were either snapped or uprooted from this tornado.", "F_scale": 2, "Wind": 125, "Source": "NWS Storm Survey", "State_1": "LA", "State_2": null, "State_3": null }, "geometry": { "type": "LineString", "coordinates": [ [ -93.323824416, 31.413213088 ], [ -93.303568374, 31.432549237 ], [ -93.294813644, 31.443826816 ], [ -93.286230575, 31.453492232 ] ] } },

The first damage produced was along CR 69, and was limited\nto trees damaging homes.  Tree damage continued as the tornado\nmoved off to the north-northeast, crossing Al HWY 43 before\nmoving over inaccessible land between HWY 43 and the Black\nWarrior River.  The tornado crossed into Hale County at\napproximately 1:53 PM and intensified, uprooting and mowing down \nhundreds of trees as it moved along Bass Lane near the Black\nWarrior.  The tornado then moved along Mason Bend Road on a\nslightly diagonal angle uprooting and snapping numerous hardwood\nand softwood trees, damaging or destroying several manufactured\nhomes, and causing a few minor injuries.  One unoccupied single-\nwide manufactured home rolled over and landed upside-down on top\nof a car.  From there it continued east-northeastward, crossing\nErie Rd and CR 92 with slightly less intense damage to trees.  As\nit approached AL HWY 14 just north of Sawyerville, several homes\nwere damaged, and one double-wide was destroyed, causing several\ninjuries.  The tornado turned over a fish truck causing the load\nof fish to be  across the road, and deposited two pickup trucks\nin a pond.  The tornado continued east-northeastward snapping and\nuprooting trees as it crossed CR 17.  As it approached CR 30, the\ntornado reached its maximum intensity of about 135 mph.  A double-\nwide manufactured home was torn from it's anchors, lofted and\ntossed approximately 50 yards across the road, causing one\nfatality and 2 serious injuries.  A site-built home diagonally\nacross the street sustained significant roof damage and broken\nglass.  A double-wide home a few hundred yards south of the first\nhome was split in two, with one half of the home remaining\nanchored while the other half appeared to roll away.  The tornado\nthen crossed wooded land and pastures on either side of Big Brush\nCreek, before crossing CR 21, snapping and uprooting numerous\ntrees along the road.  Similar but less consistent damage\ncontinued as it crossed Raspberry and Hubbard Roads before moving\nover inaccessible woods and pastures along Five Mile Creek.  The\ntornado continued to weaken as it crossed AL HWY 69 near Harper\nHill, causing only sporadic tree damage.

The tornado then weakened and continued to the\nnortheast for nearly 5 miles producing minor EF0 damage to\nresidential roofs, trees, and signs. Several homes under construction\nwith only visible studs off of FM1660 collapsed. As the tornado\napproached Chandler Road near the intersection with CR 101, the\nintensity of the tornado increased again with EF1 damage observed to\na large metal building system with sections of the roof peeled away.\nAdditional EF1 damage was observed to a stable on a property near the\nSan Gabriel River with substantial tree damage as well. As the\ntornado neared CR337, EF2 damage was observed to a home on piers as\nthe roof, most exterior walls, and some interior walls failed and\nwere moved away from the property. EF1 damage then continued as the\ntornado affected more homes and metal system buildings as the tornado\ncrossed Highway 95 and CR345. Significant EF2 damage occurred to a\nresidential home near the intersection of CR347 and CR346.

On at least three occasions, manufactured homes had residents inside them when they were picked up and thrown by tornadoes. The tornado continued to lead to widespread tree damage and roof damage to homes as it approached Lake O The Pines. Before crossing the lake, the tornado ripped the roof off of the Lake O the Pines Bait Shop before throwing multiple RVs and a motor home into the Lake O the Pines with four occupants in them that were rescued from the lake. On the opposite side of the lake in extreme northwest Marion County and extreme southeast Morris County, widespread tree damage was observed with hundreds of snapped trees. Off of FM 729, a manufactured home was picked up and rolled with an occupant in it. She suffered injuries and crawled near a half of a mile to FM 729 to get to help. The tornado continued on to completely destroy or lead to significant damage of manufactured homes along Nash Farm Rd. A metal building structure for storage of vehicles had two walls removed and its roofed, lifting pillars and throwing them several hundred feet. As the tornado continued on across more rural areas of Cass County it continued to uproot and snap trees with damage becoming more sporadic and narrow as it continued, producing EF-1 damage from just north of Avinger to west of Linden. The tornado finally lifted after it damaged the roof on a home and crossed TX-11 and TX-130.
