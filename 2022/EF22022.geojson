Radar data \nsuggests the starting point could have been slightly farther \nsouthwest than what is indicated in the survey and the ending \npoint could have been slightly farther northeast than what is \nindicated in the survey. In both cases the available public \nroad network limited access to achieve full precision. \n\nAlthough this tornado was in a rural portion of Sabine \nParish, the impressive maximum width of approximately half a mile\nallowed many residences and structures to be affected. \nApproximately 30 homes were damaged and approximately 10 to 15 \nwere heavily damaged, destroyed, or rendered unlivable. The \nsurvey suggested the tornado was most intense in a narrower \ncorridor from Highway 118 to where it crossed McInnis Road. In\nthis corridor damage indicators on several structures were at \nan EF2 level. The peak wind speed of 125 mph was associated\nwith a completely destroyed mobile home which had its remnants \nblown approximately 60 feet and piled up against a tree line. All\nof a family of 5 in the mobile home at the time of the tornado \nwere injured, with a few receiving critical injuries. Another \ninjury occurred farther downstream from this area, but this \ninjury was not critical. In addition to damage to residences, \nthere were scores of farm and outbuildings which were generally\ndestroyed and the survey team documented casualties of at least\ntwo horses. \n\nThis tornado was quite anomalous for its above average width in \nrelation to its relatively short path length. There were a few\nEF2 damage points associated with extreme swaths of tree damage, \nalthough little debarking was seen. This survey team estimates \nat least 1000 trees were either snapped or uprooted.", "F_scale": 2, "Wind": 125, "Source": null }, "geometry": { "type": "LineString", "coordinates": [ [ -93.323824416, 31.413213088 ], [ -93.303568374, 31.432549237 ], [ -93.294813644, 31.443826816 ], [ -93.286230575, 31.453492232 ] ] } },
