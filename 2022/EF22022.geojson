Radar data suggests that the starting point could have been slightly farther southwest than what is indicated in the survey and the ending point could have been slightly farther northeast than what was indicated. However, limited public road access prevented a more accurate starting and ending point.\nThe maximum width of this tornado was approximately a half a mile, which allowed many residences and structures to be affected. Approximately 30 homes were damaged, with 10-15 homes either heavily damaged, destroyed, or rendered unlivable. The survey suggested that the tornado was most intense in a narrower corridor from Highway 118 where it crossed McInnis Road, where damage indicators of several structures suggested EF-2 winds. The peak wind speed of 125 mph was associated with a completely destroyed mobile home which had its remnants blown approximately 60 feet and piled up against a tree line. A family of 5 inside the mobile home were all injured, with a couple receiving critical injuries. Another injury occurred farther downstream from this area but this injury was not critical. In addition to damage to residences, there were scores of farms and outbuildings which were generally destroyed, with casualties of at least two horses.\nThis tornado was quite anomalous for its above average width in relation to its relatively short path length. There were a few EF-2 damage points associated with extreme swaths of tree damage, although little tree debarking was seen. It is estimated that at least 1000 trees were either snapped or uprooted from this tornado.", "F_scale": 2, "Wind": 125, "Source": "NWS Storm Survey", "State_1": "LA", "State_2": null, "State_3": null, "SPC_id": null, "NCEI_id": "993932" }, "geometry": { "type": "LineString", "coordinates": [ [ -93.323824416, 31.413213088 ], [ -93.303568374, 31.432549237 ], [ -93.294813644, 31.443826816 ], [ -93.286230575, 31.453492232 ] ] } },

The tornado touched down just south of Greene County Road 69 in the Charleston Swamp east of Tishabee and west of Riverwalk Road. The first damage produced was along County Road 69, and was limited to trees damaging homes. Mainly tree damage continued as the tornado tracked northeast and crossed Alabama Highway 43. The tornado continued northeast over inaccessible land between Highway 43 and the Black Warrior River. The tornado crossed into Hale County in the Mason Bend area of the Black Warrior River basin. National Weather Service meteorologists surveyed damage in western Hale County and determined that it was consistent with an EF2 tornado, with maximum winds near 135 mph. The tornado crossed into Hale County from Greene County and intensified, uprooting and mowing down hundreds of trees as it moved along Bass Lane near the Black Warrior. The tornado then crossed Mason Bend Road where it snapped numerous hardwood and softwood trees, destroying several manufactured homes, and which resulted in a few minor injuries. One unoccupied single-wide manufactured home rolled over and landed upside-down on top of a car. From there it continued east-northeast, crossing Erie Road and County Road 92 with slightly less intense damage to trees. As it approached Alabama Highway 14, just north of Sawyerville, several homes were damaged, and one double-wide was destroyed, causing several injuries. The tornado turned over a fish truck causing the load of fish to be scattered across the road, and it deposited two pickup trucks into a nearby pond. The tornado continued east-northeast snapping and uprooting trees as it crossed County Road 17.\nAs it approached County Road 30, the tornado reached its maximum intensity of about 135 mph. A double-wide manufactured home was torn from its anchors, lofted and tossed approximately 50 yards across the road, resulting in one fatality and two serious injuries. A site-built home across the street sustained significant roof damage and broken glass. A double-wide manufactured home a few hundred yards south of the first home was split in two, with one half of the home remaining anchored while the other half rolled away. The tornado then crossed wooded land and pastures on either side of Big Brush Creek, before crossing County Road 21, snapping and uprooting numerous trees. Similar, but less consistent damage, continued as it crossed Raspberry and Hubbard Roads before moving over inaccessible woods and pastures along Five Mile Creek. The tornado continued to weaken as it crossed Highway 69 near Harper Hill, causing only sporadic tree damage.

The tornado tracked to that interchange moving into Williamson County and then moved northeastward across the county and into Bell County approximately 0.8 miles east of CR 352. Touchdown was found near the Silverstone subdivision where some shingles were torn off roofs and fences blown down. This was rated weak EF0 damage. The tornado quickly strengthened to EF1 as it continued to cross a residential area and business park where a section of roof was lifted off a warehouse building and several empty semi-trailers were tipped over. Several trees were snapped and air conditioning units were blown off the roofs of several buildings. The tornado crossed the I-35/Hwy 45 intersection and entered a large retail shopping center where roof and window damage was observed on several businesses. Still an EF1, the tornado crossed Dell Way and entered the Windy Terrace and Greenlawn Place neighborhoods. Widespread tree and roof damage was observed to multiple homes, a few lost their entire roof indicating the tornado had strengthened briefly to EF2. The tornado likely weakened a bit before regaining EF2 strength as it moved northeast and crossed Gattis School Rd. where substantial roof damage was seen on some homes near the intersection of Gattis School Rd. and windy Park Dr. The Clay Madsen Recreation Center and the adjacent playing fields sustained damage as well. The storm crossed A.W.Grimes Blvd. and entered the South Creek neighborhood where tree and roof damage was once again observed across many streets until it exited the neighborhood at Brushy Creek. Before crossing Hwy 79 the tornado made a slight right turn and started to parallel the south side of Hwy 79 and moved through the parking lot of the Kalahari Resort where multiple vehicles were damaged, trees blown down, and some windows of the resort were broken from flying debris. The tornado was likely at high end EF1 strength when it followed Brushy Creek into the Forest Bluff neighborhood off Red Bud Ln. Trees were blown down along the creek and several homes sustained roof damage where large sections of roof were blown off the house. The tornado crossed Red Bud Ln. and damaged a few businesses at the Red Bud Ln. and CR123 intersection. Shortly after crossing Hwy 79 east of Red Bud Ln., the tornado produced EF1 damage to an industrial park complex to numerous metal warehouse buildings. The tornado then weakened and continued to the northeast for nearly 5 miles producing minor EF0 damage to residential roofs, trees, and signs. Just east of FM1660, several homes under construction with only visible studs collapsed. As the tornado approached Chandler Rd. near the intersection with CR 101, the intensity of the tornado increased again with EF1 damage observed to a large metal building system with sections of the roof peeled away. Additional EF1 damage was observed to a stable on a property near the San Gabriel River with substantial tree damage as well. As the tornado neared CR337, EF2 damage was observed to a home on piers as the roof, most exterior walls, and some interior walls failed and were moved away from the property. As the tornado crossed Hwy 95 and CR345 EF1 damage was found on more homes and metal system buildings. Significant EF2 damage occurred to a home near the intersection of CR347 and CR346. The tornado then produced EF1 damage to trees, power poles, and a few structures as it crossed CR348, FM971, CR352, and CR357 before exiting Williamson County and entering Bell County. The maximum width of the tornado and its damage path was roughly 500 yards with maximum winds at 135 mph, the high end of EF2. Most of the 29-mile-long track however was at EF1 strength. There were reports of a total of 16 injuries, most of which were minor. There were no reported fatalities with this tornado. This tornado crossed the Williamson/Bell County line moving towards the north-northeast, crossing Alligator Rd where some power poles and trees were damaged. The tornado continued northeast, damaging more trees and power poles near FM-487 and along Donahoe Rd. It is believed to have lifted just as it was crossing FM-2268 east of the town of Vilas.

Significant damage was observed through this region to many homes. This included the destruction of multiple mobile homes, significant roof damage to numerous slab homes, two homes having their second story destroyed, numerous large tree limbs, tree trunks, and power poles snapped, barns destroyed, and a large electrical transmission tower toppled. Pockets of high-end EF-2 damage occurred through this region.

Damage through this region was generally rated EF-1. As the tornado reached U.S. 290 it produced significant damage to a metal framed business, buckling the roof purlins and collapsing in the south facing wall. The tornado then rolled an adjacent mobile home into and partially on top of the south facing wall of another metal framed business. Three individuals in the mobile home were injured. Damage to the business and mobile home was on the order of high-end EF-1 to low-end EF-2.

The tornado began to intensify and develop a widespread damage swath of uprooted and snapped trees as it approached Highway 271 several miles south of Gilmer. Prior to reaching Highway 271, the tornado ripped the roof off of a single family home and tore down a wall of the home. As the tornado continued on, it reached its maximum width of 700 yards or 0.4 miles as it crossed Highway 700. The tornado intensified further as it crossed Azalea Road and Highway 154. Just before reaching this road, the tornado hit a two-story single family home, removing the home's second floor and tearing down a front exterior wall. This led to the tornado's estimated maximum wind speed of 135 mph, the strongest EF-2 rating on the Enhanced Fujita Scale. A nearby mobile home was also destroyed, with an occupant injured.\nThe tornado continued to track northeast and ripped off a roof of a single family home, and completely destroyed one double-wide and multiple single-wide manufactured homes. The tornado also led to structural damage to several two-story family homes with portions of the roofs removed and a projectile leading to a large hole in the side of a home. A guest house that had a frame nailed into the ground was wiped clean from its foundation with its occupant hospitalized.\nAs the tornado continued to track northeast, it led to more structural damage to single family homes and complete destruction to manufactured homes between Gilmer and Ore City. On at least three occasions, manufactured homes had residents inside of them when they were picked up and thrown by the tornado. Additional widespread tree and roof damage to homes continued as the tornado approached Lake O' the Pines. Before crossing the lake into Western Marion County, the tornado ripped the roof off of the Lake O' the Pines Bait Shop before throwing multiple RV's and a motor home into the lake. Four occupants in these RV's were injured but were rescued from the lake. This is a continuation of the Upshur County EF-2 tornado. This tornado, which had weakened to an EF-1 with estimated maximum winds near 110 mph as it entered far Western Marion County, continued to track northeast across Jordan Drive and FM 729. The tornado damaged the roof of a home on Jordan Drive, with a metal building structure for storage of vehicles having two walls and its roof removed, lifting pillars and throwing them several hundred feet. Widespread tree damage was observed with hundreds of snapped trees. Off of FM 729, a manufactured home was picked up and rolled with an occupant in it. She suffered injuries and walked nearly a half mile to FM 729 to get to help. The tornado also significantly damaged or destroyed manufactured homes along Nash Farm Road. Winds from this tornado also caused three wooden power poles to lean significantly off of Morris County Cutoff Road, before the tornado crossed over into extreme Southeast Morris County. This is a continuation of the Upshur/Marion County EF-2 tornado. This tornado, which remained an EF-1 with estimated maximum winds near 110 mph from far Western Marion County, snapped numerous trees in far Southeast Morris County along and east of Morris County Cutoff Road/County Road 2307, before entering Southwestern Cass County. This is a continuation of the Upshur/Western Marion/Southeast Morris County EF-2 tornado. This tornado, which maintained an EF-1 rating with estimated maximum winds around 105 mph, continued to uproot and snap trees and Southwest and Central Cass County with damage becoming more sporadic and narrow as it tracked northeast across FM 161, County Road 1599, Highway 49, County Road 1577, Highway 11, before finally lifting just east of Highway 130.

Strong damaging winds accompanied the rear flank downdraft associated with the tornado resulting in damage to outdoor bleachers and small outbuildings by the sports field. A bus was also overturned in the parking lot with minor structural damage to the backside of the school. The tornado continued tracking northeast, both widening and strengthening impacting several homes and snapping/uprooting multiple trees and snapping powerlines as it crossed Highway 17. This was the strongest point along the tornado path with near 110mph winds. The tornado continued tracking northeast causing more sporadic EF0 to EF1 damage along the rest of its path to the Marengo County border with damage generally limited to a few snapped/uprooted softwood and hardwood trees, along with minor roof damage to a few homes. The tornado began to strengthen and widen again as it approached the Tombigbee River with the last accessible damage point on Ararat Road where there was notable snapped softwood/hardwood trees. The tornado crossed into Marengo County before briefly crossing back into Choctaw County before again moving back into Marengo County. National Weather Service meteorologists surveyed damage in southwest Marengo County and determined that it was consistent with an EF2 tornado, with maximum winds near 125 mph. This tornado originated in Choctaw County before crossing into extreme southwest Marengo County. A corridor of uprooted softwood trees was first observed near the Marengo County line where the trees were toppled across Blue Rock Road. The tornado tracked northeast near the intersection of Highway 69 and County Road 9. This area contained the highest degree and widest swath of damage noted on the survey where the tornado was likely at its strongest. There were considerable and continuous swaths of uprooted hardwood and softwood trees in addition to multiple snapped trunks. A manufactured home on County Road 9 was completely destroyed as the undercarriage rolled at least 30 yards from its foundation.
