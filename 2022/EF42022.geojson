The tornado began northwest of Macksburg in western Madision county. The tornado remained in mostly rural cropland and wooded areas of western Madison county. The tornado passed through Pammel State Park southwest of Winterset producing extensive tree damage as the tornado continued to widen into a wedge tornado. Upon exiting the park, the tornado travelled along Carver Road. Several residential homes were extensively damaged or destroyed along Carver Road and six deaths occurred along this stretch of road. The tornado was at peak intensity at this time with EF4 damage occurring west of the intersection of Carver Road and Highway 169 with a house completely destoyed and removed from the foundation. After departing the Carver Road corridor, the tornado progressed just southeast of Winterset and eventually passed east of town and crossing State Highway 92. Damage in these areas was primarily to trees and outbuildings although a few homes were also impacted with mostly EF1 to EF2 damage. From Highway 92 to where the tornado exited the county, it remained mostly in rural cropland and wooded areas with numerous trees impacted. The tornado then moved into Warren county from Madison county. This is a continuation of the tornado which started in Madison county and passed into Warren county. The tornado remained very broad with a maximum width of up to 500 yards at times. Video evidence supports a multi-vortex circulation with the tornado across much of Warren county. The tornado cross Interstate 35 shortly after entering the county but fortunately, no vehicles were impacted. The tornado remained in rural areas to the west southwest of Norwalk producing mostly tree and outbuilding damage. The tornado passed along the southeast edge of Norwalk producing EF0 to EF1 damage along Coolidge Street and along Highway G14 near Warrior Run Golf Course. The tornado crossed Highway 5 just west of the intersections of Highway 5 and Highway 69 approaching the southeast side of Des Moines. The tornado entered into Polk county shortly after crossing Highway 69 near the intersection of Highway 69 and Indianola Avenue. This tornado passed from Warren county into Polk county near the intersection of Highway 69 and County Line Road. The tornado crossed E Pine Avenue removing the roof of a house and then clipped the north edge of Avon producing EF2 damage to a couple of houses. The tornado then crossed the Des Moines River and impacted the Woodland Hills neighborhood damaging muliple structures. The damage continued to the northeast into less inhabited areas of eastern Polk county, however the tornado remained strong with EF2 damage at several locations along its path. The tornado crossed University Avenue near its intersection with NE 112th Street and then exited the county into Jasper county. The tornado moved into Jasper county from Polk county. The tornado remained largely in rural areas for much of its path across Jasper county. Despite its rural venture, the tornado impacted several residences in western Jasper county producing several areas of EF2 damage. The tornado did pass not far from the southeast side of Colfax damaging structures near the intersection of Highway 117 and S 44th Avenue West. The tornado crossed Interstate 80 east of Colfax near mile marker 160 and then proceeded towards Newton, grazing both the communities of Lambs Grove and Newton on the north sides. Most of the damage was to trees and minor damage to structures including loss of shingles and broken windows. The tornado did remove about a 100 foot segment of the roof of the former TPI Composites Plant northeast of Newton with the tornado dissipating shortly thereafter. In all, the tornado had a path length of just over 70 miles and passed through four counties including Madison, Warren, Polk and Jasper. The six deaths were the most by a tornado in Iowa since the Parkersburg tornado in May of 2008. The damage was into the hundreds of millions of dollars.", "F_scale": 4, "Wind": 170, "Source": "NWS Storm Survey", "State_1": "IA", "State_2": null, "State_3": null, "SPC_id": 620989, "NCEI_id": "1007076, 1007094, 1007096, 1007103", "Tornado_type": "Tornado", "Storm_morphology": "Supercell" }, "geometry": { "type": "LineString", "coordinates": [ [ -94.201282254, 41.233393892 ], [ -94.193643323, 41.234878464 ], [ -94.187978497, 41.236298457 ], [ -94.183858624, 41.238492932 ], [ -94.178022137, 41.241784506 ], [ -94.171756497, 41.244882306 ], [ -94.160684338, 41.24998045 ], [ -94.147552243, 41.255723452 ], [ -94.126609555, 41.265724104 ], [ -94.091504803, 41.281205963 ], [ -94.054824707, 41.298819725 ], [ -94.047443268, 41.301785861 ], [ -94.031650421, 41.306944037 ], [ -94.027015564, 41.310425575 ], [ -94.020149109, 41.313004373 ], [ -93.979980347, 41.331826503 ], [ -93.95302951, 41.343555354 ], [ -93.933975098, 41.350514333 ], [ -93.879215118, 41.373319106 ], [ -93.819305298, 41.401910404 ], [ -93.783771393, 41.423023829 ], [ -93.719570038, 41.449791959 ], [ -93.685237762, 41.461628188 ], [ -93.660861847, 41.468960419 ], [ -93.640777466, 41.47796378 ], [ -93.615543243, 41.488637573 ], [ -93.596488831, 41.500081012 ], [ -93.575546143, 41.512165146 ], [ -93.505851624, 41.539281956 ], [ -93.463279602, 41.559451544 ], [ -93.424312469, 41.57717503 ], [ -93.406288025, 41.585264571 ], [ -93.372470734, 41.59758954 ], [ -93.335735199, 41.617227597 ], [ -93.304321167, 41.631471073 ], [ -93.281661865, 41.644172059 ], [ -93.222782013, 41.662898238 ], [ -93.173686859, 41.677516264 ], [ -93.138152954, 41.690977299 ], [ -93.093349335, 41.702769414 ], [ -93.065196869, 41.712509096 ], [ -93.05043399, 41.71725025 ], [ -93.025543091, 41.729293769 ], [ -93.013526794, 41.734033684 ] ] } },

The violent tornado began just west of the Bryan County Courthouse in Pembroke, where it damaged part of the roof, blew out some windows, and snapped numerous trees. The tornado continued along a northeast path across a wooded, marshy area, including C C Road, Stubbs Farm Road, and Stubby Road. In this area, the tornado produced significant tree damage, and heavily damaged a residence on Stubbs Farm Road. The tornado then continued east-northeast moving through Hendrix Park, Park Place subdivision, and Black Creek Golf Course, where it reached a maximum width of 3/4 of a mile and peak EF-4 intensity. Across this area, the tornado extensively damaged most homes, structures and trees. Some homes and structures were completely destroyed. Several injuries, some serious, occurred in this area as well. The tornado then continued east-northeast over wooded and marshy areas, across Olive Branch Road and across the southern end of Homestead Drive. Several mobile homes were completely destroyed in this area, causing additional injuries and tragically claiming the life of an adult female. The tornado began to weaken as it moved toward the interchange of I-16 and U.S. Highway 280. In this area, there was some minor roof damage to a large industrial building off of Oracal Parkway Circle, as well as some snapping and uprooting of trees. The tornado finally dissipated in a marshy region just east of Oracal Parkway Circle.", "F_scale": 4, "Wind": 185, "Source": "NWS Storm Survey", "State_1": "GA", "State_2": null, "State_3": null, "SPC_id": 621282, "NCEI_id": "1014520", "Tornado_type": "Tornado", "Storm_morphology": "Supercell" }, "geometry": { "type": "LineString", "coordinates": [ [ -81.656144408, 32.12022603 ], [ -81.539414672, 32.164194667 ], [ -81.510747222, 32.172186687 ], [ -81.476157455, 32.179269936 ], [ -81.449292449, 32.182684228 ], [ -81.422470359, 32.185371986 ] ] } },

The tornado continued into Choctaw County Oklahoma and additional information about the damage in that county can be found in a separate entry. Several dozen individual homes, businesses and outbuildings were impacted across western and northern Lamar County. Damage consistent with EF-3 intensity tornadic winds of 150-160 mph were identified at several locations west through north of Paris. In particular, several residences along Farm Market Road 1499 northwest of Paris were completely unroofed, with most external and internal walls destroyed. This damage was consistent with tornado intensities of approximately 160 mph. One particular house on CR 33620 revealed EF-4 damage, with estimated winds of at least 170 MPH. EF-3 damage of 145 to 155 mph was also identified with a small number of structures along Farm to Market Road 906 near Mideity, as well as with a residence along Farm to Market Road 2820 west-northwest of Paris. Primary damage to these structures was the total loss of roofs and large-scale interior and exterior wall failure. EF-2 damage, consistent with winds of 111 to 135 mph, was identified with a number of other structures along the tornado's path. Structures with this degree of damage had either all or large portions of their roofs destroyed or significantly damaged, with some wall failures. Widespread EF-1 damage was also apparent all along the track from Brookston to east of Arthur City, as evidenced by trees uprooted, power poles snapped, outbuildings severely damaged, and/or wood frame homes with serious roof damage. Maximum estimated winds were 170 mph. This tornado developed in Lamar County, Texas, and produced EF-4 damage northwest of Paris, and then crossed the Red River into Choctaw County. Extensive tree damage occurred just north of the Red River with numerous hardwood trees snapped from E2150 Road to E2140 Road. The tornado moved northeast, becoming about a mile wide several miles south of Sawyer, and continued to produce a very wide damage swath until a couple miles north of Highway 70. Throughout the path, numerous trees were snapped and uprooted, numerous power poles were snapped, numerous outbuildings were destroyed, and 38 homes were damaged, at least sixteen of which were severely damaged. The tornado dissipated between the N 4340 Road and N 4360 Road, and south of the E1980 Road. Based on the damage in Choctaw County, maximum estimated wind in this segment of the tornado was 110 to 120 mph.", "F_scale": 4, "Wind": 170, "Source": "NWS Storm Survey", "State_1": "TX", "State_2": "OK", "State_3": null, "SPC_id": 621962, "NCEI_id": "1062581, 1063292", "Tornado_type": "Tornado", "Storm_morphology": "Supercell" }, "geometry": { "type": "LineString", "coordinates": [ [ -95.749036096, 33.599460692 ], [ -95.745857518, 33.604525982 ], [ -95.741995137, 33.609422665 ], [ -95.73366956, 33.619286671 ], [ -95.717510399, 33.638609798 ], [ -95.701760468, 33.652507292 ], [ -95.695366081, 33.658687205 ], [ -95.688737195, 33.664589403 ], [ -95.675753769, 33.676188596 ], [ -95.66444711, 33.686446229 ], [ -95.658610623, 33.692052396 ], [ -95.652945798, 33.696872692 ], [ -95.642122022, 33.709117195 ], [ -95.630775765, 33.721626155 ], [ -95.622383979, 33.732773706 ], [ -95.618221191, 33.73919766 ], [ -95.614401725, 33.74544271 ], [ -95.603481606, 33.756885181 ], [ -95.580953774, 33.782548902 ], [ -95.568765816, 33.795816837 ], [ -95.556062874, 33.807656375 ], [ -95.545934853, 33.822061315 ], [ -95.539068398, 33.828763777 ], [ -95.534948525, 33.832186108 ], [ -95.531000313, 33.837034176 ], [ -95.525507149, 33.839885852 ], [ -95.518593401, 33.843324557 ], [ -95.513636679, 33.84681759 ], [ -95.506383986, 33.851647007 ], [ -95.499045462, 33.85651179 ], [ -95.492629618, 33.860396289 ], [ -95.477976636, 33.874834784 ], [ -95.469200448, 33.882245663 ], [ -95.463683219, 33.888045967 ], [ -95.457884952979327, 33.896001938121351 ], [ -95.448658153502436, 33.906616542810532 ], [ -95.418917819945307, 33.939378415556583 ], [ -95.394069835631342, 33.964546515928539 ], [ -95.359222576109858, 34.00866732312921 ], [ -95.340854808775873, 34.031933523105415 ], [ -95.310856983153315, 34.064042284475597 ], [ -95.307938739745111, 34.069481849061283 ], [ -95.301501438109369, 34.08924197344664 ], [ -95.296394512145014, 34.112379051135811 ], [ -95.294162914244623, 34.116145267473492 ] ] } },
{ "type": "Feature", "properties": { "fid": 5, "Start_time": "2022-11-04T23:15:00", "End_time": "2022-11-05T00:21:00", "Width": 1056, "Length": 60.23, "Fatalities": 0, "Injuries": 13, "Damage": 37000000, "Narrative": "An EF-4 tornado initially touched down near the Fulbright community southwest of Clarksville. An aerial survey confirmed that the tornado damage was to tin metal roof panels that were peeled off of a plant on CR-1200. As the tornado continued northeast, near FM-411, a single family home had all of its walls removed with only the interior room left standing where a family of three sheltered where winds were estimated at 150 mph. After it crossed FM-411, it hit another single family home and collapsed all the walls, injuring a woman who left her vehicle to take shelter inside the home. The tornado continued on to CR-1275 where debarking of a few trees was first observed in addition to thousands of trees that were snapped and uprooted throughout the path of the tornado. It then crossed US-82, CR-2123, CR-2124, and FM-2283. At FM-2283, it destroyed a single family home along with several outbuildings. This area could not be surveyed at this location as debris removal had already begun. The tornado then continued to move along CR-2125 and CR-2030 before taking a more eastward jog across SH-37. At this point, it is estimated that it was about a third of a mile wide and it began to widen further as it demonstrated more widespread tree snaps and isolated debarking throughout the remainder of Red River County. After crossing SH-37, the tornado wiped a single family home off of its foundation north of Clarksville with large portions of the walls and roof carried several hundred yards northeast of the home. This damage was surrounded by widespread tree snaps with isolated debarking. This location was reviewed by a regional Quick Response Team (QRT) that determined the damage at this location was EF-4 with maximum winds of 170 mph. This was based on the construction of the home, the debris field spread 50-200 yards downstream from the home in small pieces, and the slab of the home being wiped clean. Ten people on the property of the home took shelter in an oil drain of a metal outbuilding that was completely destroyed with no injuries. The damage swath widened to approximately 0.6 miles northeast of Clarksville as it approached Acworth and continued to cross the Red River. Before it crossed the Red River, it collapsed all the walls on a single family home and completely destroyed Mount Olive Church. It then lifted a double-wide manufactured home off the ground near FM-1159 and threw it 50 yards with three dogs inside that all survived. The tornado then crossed the Red River into south-central McCurtain County, Oklahoma. This is the continuation of the Red River County Texas EF-4 tornado. This tornado had weakened upon entering Southern McCurtain County Oklahoma, producing EF-2 damage in rural areas southwest of Idabel, ripping the roofs off of several single family homes. Shortly before entering Idabel, the outer edge of this tornado hit the Oklahoma Mesonet observing platform located about 5 miles to the southwest off of Ravens Nest Road. An anemometer located 10 meters above the platform measured a wind gust of 108 mph, with a nearby single family home sustaining roof damage where EF-2 winds estimated near 125 mph removed a large section of the roof structure with a wall collapsing on another single family home off of Osprey Road. The tornado continued on to snap several hundred trees before hitting a single family home off of Boss Road which had a wall collapse and partial roof damage that could not be rated due to trees falling into the home. More EF-2 damage was observed as the tornado approached Highway 259 when the tornado removed the roof and much of the second story off of a single family home. The two people in the home took shelter on the first floor under the stairs, preventing injury as winds estimated at 125 mph damaged the home. As the tornado moved northeast across Stone Haven Road, a Davis weather station recorded a gust of approximately 130 mph.\nUpon entering Idabel, the tornado damaged additional roofs of homes in several neighborhoods on the southeast side of town. One of the most hard hit subdivisions was Country Club Estates. None of the homes in the Country Club Estates were rated due to tree damage which resulted in much of the structural damage from trees falling into homes. Nearby at the Idabel Country Club, nearly every tree sustained damage on approximately six holes, with mostly snaps observed. There was also some debarking of trees in this area, where an EF-3 swath of damage had begun. Behind the golf course, a single family home was destroyed with most of its walls collapsed except for a small interior room.\nThe tornado continued to move northeast, hitting the Kiamichi Family Medical Center where EF-2 damage (near 115 mph) was estimated due to the facade components that were torn from the structure. As the tornado approached Highway 259 and East Washington Street, it damaged the sign of a McDonald's and a swath of EF-3 winds completely destroyed the Donut Crossing and Express Tire stores. A sign from the Donut Crossing store was lofted by the tornado and carried 14.3 miles where it was found on the west side of Eagletown. After crossing East Washington Street, the tornado completely destroyed the Trinity Baptist Church. Winds at this location were estimated to be near 155 mph with the total destruction of the metal building system which was surrounded by a brick wall that collapsed with concrete anchors pulled up from the ground. The tornado moved on to produce narrow EF-2 damage in the more broader EF-1 damage swath with small vorticies likely extending down to the ground from the elevated large funnel cloud at this point.\nAfter moving northeast of Idabel, the tornado crossed mainly rural areas and completely destroyed chicken houses while snapping hardwood and softwood trees for approximately the next ten miles. An areal survey indicates that the tornado briefly lifted near the Little River and then touched down again in a forested area before damaging a metal structure atop a chicken plant off of Craig Road. A survey team from the National Weather Service Little Rock office found EF-2 damage with 135 mph winds between Eagletown and Broken Bow just south of Highway 70, where numerous trees and several wooden utility poles were snapped near the base near the Tyson Craig Feed Mill, a large elevator structure on top of a silo collapsed with a portion of a metal roof and walls ripped off of an adjacent metal building, and a doublewide manufactured home at the eastern end of Box Turtle Road was thrown off of its concrete pad, nearly pulling out an underground shelter, rolling over it, and landing about 30 feet to the north. Over half of the house was stripped of the undercarriage. Only about one-third of the walls/roof were left with the remainder of the structure removed and scattered well to the north.\nAs the tornado crossed Highway 70 just west of Eagletown, many additional pines and hardwoods were snapped and uprooted. Nearly all utility poles within the path were also snapped or pushed over.
