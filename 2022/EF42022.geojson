The tornado moved northeastward across a wooded, marshy area, including C C, Stubbs Farms and Stubbs Roads. In this area it produced massive tree damage, and heavily damaged a residence on Stubbs Farm Road. The tornado then continued east-northeast moving through Hendrix Park, Park Place subdivision, and Black Creek Golf Course, where it reached it maximum EF-4 intensity of 185 mph, and width of approximately 3/4 of a mile. Across this area the tornado extensively damaged most of the homes, structures and trees. Some homes and structures were completely destroyed. Several injures, some serious, occurred in this area as well. The tornado continued east-northeast over wooded and marshy areas, across Olive Branch Road and then across the southern end of Homestead Drive. Several mobile homes were completely destroyed, and one fatality and additional injuries occurred in this area. The tornado began to weaken as it moved toward the interchange of I-16 and U.S. Highway 280. In this area there was some minor roof damage to a large industrial building off of Oracal Parkway Circle, as well as some snapping and uprooting of trees. It finally dissipated in a marshy region just east of Oracal Parkway Circle.", "F_scale": 4, "Wind": 185, "Source": null, "State_1": "GA", "State_2": null, "State_3": null }, "geometry": { "type": "LineString", "coordinates": [ [ -81.656144408, 32.12022603 ], [ -81.539414672, 32.164194667 ], [ -81.510747222, 32.172186687 ], [ -81.476157455, 32.179269936 ], [ -81.448262481, 32.182938479 ] ] } }
