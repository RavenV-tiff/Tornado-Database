The tornado began northwest of Macksburg in western Madision county. The tornado remained in mostly rural cropland and wooded areas of western Madison county. The tornado passed through Pammel State Park southwest of Winterset producing extensive tree damage as the tornado continued to widen into a wedge tornado. Upon exiting the park, the tornado travelled along Carver Road. Several residential homes were extensively damaged or destroyed along Carver Road and six deaths occurred along this stretch of road. The tornado was at peak intensity at this time with EF4 damage occurring west of the intersection of Carver Road and Highway 169 with a house completely destoyed and removed from the foundation. After departing the Carver Road corridor, the tornado progressed just southeast of Winterset and eventually passed east of town and crossing State Highway 92. Damage in these areas was primarily to trees and outbuildings although a few homes were also impacted with mostly EF1 to EF2 damage. From Highway 92 to where the tornado exited the county, it remained mostly in rural cropland and wooded areas with numerous trees impacted. The tornado then moved into Warren county from Madison county. This is a continuation of the tornado which started in Madison county and passed into Warren county. The tornado remained very broad with a maximum width of up to 500 yards at times. Video evidence supports a multi-vortex circulation with the tornado across much of Warren county. The tornado cross Interstate 35 shortly after entering the county but fortunately, no vehicles were impacted. The tornado remained in rural areas to the west southwest of Norwalk producing mostly tree and outbuilding damage. The tornado passed along the southeast edge of Norwalk producing EF0 to EF1 damage along Coolidge Street and along Highway G14 near Warrior Run Golf Course. The tornado crossed Highway 5 just west of the intersections of Highway 5 and Highway 69 approaching the southeast side of Des Moines. The tornado entered into Polk county shortly after crossing Highway 69 near the intersection of Highway 69 and Indianola Avenue. This tornado passed from Warren county into Polk county near the intersection of Highway 69 and County Line Road. The tornado crossed E Pine Avenue removing the roof of a house and then clipped the north edge of Avon producing EF2 damage to a couple of houses. The tornado then crossed the Des Moines River and impacted the Woodland Hills neighborhood damaging muliple structures. The damage continued to the northeast into less inhabited areas of eastern Polk county, however the tornado remained strong with EF2 damage at several locations along its path. The tornado crossed University Avenue near its intersection with NE 112th Street and then exited the county into Jasper county. The tornado moved into Jasper county from Polk county. The tornado remained largely in rural areas for much of its path across Jasper county. Despite its rural venture, the tornado impacted several residences in western Jasper county producing several areas of EF2 damage. The tornado did pass not far from the southeast side of Colfax damaging structures near the intersection of Highway 117 and S 44th Avenue West. The tornado crossed Interstate 80 east of Colfax near mile marker 160 and then proceeded towards Newton, grazing both the communities of Lambs Grove and Newton on the north sides. Most of the damage was to trees and minor damage to structures including loss of shingles and broken windows. The tornado did remove about a 100 foot segment of the roof of the former TPI Composites Plant northeast of Newton with the tornado dissipating shortly thereafter. In all, the tornado had a path length of just over 70 miles and passed through four counties including Madison, Warren, Polk and Jasper. The six deaths were the most by a tornado in Iowa since the Parkersburg tornado in May of 2008. The damage was into the hundreds of millions of dollars.", "F_scale": 4, "Wind": 170, "Source": "NWS Storm Survey", "State_1": "IA", "State_2": null, "State_3": null, "SPC_id": null, "NCEI_id": "1007076, 1007094, 1007096, 1007103" }, "geometry": { "type": "LineString", "coordinates": [ [ -94.201282254, 41.233393892 ], [ -94.193643323, 41.234878464 ], [ -94.187978497, 41.236298457 ], [ -94.183858624, 41.238492932 ], [ -94.178022137, 41.241784506 ], [ -94.171756497, 41.244882306 ], [ -94.160684338, 41.24998045 ], [ -94.147552243, 41.255723452 ], [ -94.126609555, 41.265724104 ], [ -94.091504803, 41.281205963 ], [ -94.054824707, 41.298819725 ], [ -94.047443268, 41.301785861 ], [ -94.031650421, 41.306944037 ], [ -94.027015564, 41.310425575 ], [ -94.020149109, 41.313004373 ], [ -93.979980347, 41.331826503 ], [ -93.95302951, 41.343555354 ], [ -93.933975098, 41.350514333 ], [ -93.879215118, 41.373319106 ], [ -93.819305298, 41.401910404 ], [ -93.783771393, 41.423023829 ], [ -93.719570038, 41.449791959 ], [ -93.685237762, 41.461628188 ], [ -93.660861847, 41.468960419 ], [ -93.640777466, 41.47796378 ], [ -93.615543243, 41.488637573 ], [ -93.596488831, 41.500081012 ], [ -93.577338, 41.511646 ], [ -93.505851624, 41.539281956 ], [ -93.463279602, 41.559451544 ], [ -93.424312469, 41.57717503 ], [ -93.406288025, 41.585264571 ], [ -93.372470734, 41.59758954 ], [ -93.335735199, 41.617227597 ], [ -93.304321167, 41.631471073 ], [ -93.281661865, 41.644172059 ], [ -93.222782013, 41.662898238 ], [ -93.173686859, 41.677516264 ], [ -93.138152954, 41.690977299 ], [ -93.093349335, 41.702769414 ], [ -93.065196869, 41.712509096 ], [ -93.05043399, 41.71725025 ], [ -93.025543091, 41.729293769 ], [ -93.013526794, 41.734033684 ] ] } },

The tornado continued along a northeast path across a wooded, marshy area, including C C Road, Stubbs Farm Road, and Stubby Road. In this area, the tornado produced significant tree damage, and heavily damaged a residence on Stubbs Farm Road. The tornado then continued east-northeast moving through Hendrix Park, Park Place subdivision, and Black Creek Golf Course, where it reached a maximum width of 3/4 of a mile and peak EF-4 intensity. Across this area, the tornado extensively damaged most homes, structures and trees. Some homes and structures were completely destroyed. Several injuries, some serious, occurred in this area as well. The tornado then continued east-northeast over wooded and marshy areas, across Olive Branch Road and across the southern end of Homestead Drive. Several mobile homes were completely destroyed in this area, causing additional injuries and tragically claiming the life of an adult female. The tornado began to weaken as it moved toward the interchange of I-16 and U.S. Highway 280. In this area, there was some minor roof damage to a large industrial building off of Oracal Parkway Circle, as well as some snapping and uprooting of trees. The tornado finally dissipated in a marshy region just east of Oracal Parkway Circle.", "F_scale": 4, "Wind": 185, "Source": "NWS Storm Survey", "State_1": "GA", "State_2": null, "State_3": null, "SPC_id": null, "NCEI_id": "1014520" }, "geometry": { "type": "LineString", "coordinates": [ [ -81.656144408, 32.12022603 ], [ -81.539414672, 32.164194667 ], [ -81.510747222, 32.172186687 ], [ -81.476157455, 32.179269936 ], [ -81.449292449, 32.182684228 ], [ -81.422470359, 32.185371986 ] ] } },

A National Weather Service survey team assessed tornado damage across Lamar County, Texas in the wake of storms which occurred Friday afternoon, November 4th. A tornado formed near Brookston in western Lamar County and tracked rapidly northeastward, passing to the northwest of Paris, Texas before exiting the northern edge of Lamar County, east of Arthur City. The exact length of the tornado is not yet pinpointed, but is believed to be at least 20 miles in length. The tornado continued into Choctaw County in far southeast Oklahoma, and the track in that county is being surveyed by personnel from NWS Tulsa. Several dozen individual homes, businesses and outbuildings were impacted across western and northern Lamar County. Damage consistent with EF-3 intensity tornadic winds of 150-160 mph were identified at several locations west through north of Paris. In particular, several residences along Farm Market Road 1499 northwest of Paris were completely unroofed, with most external and internal walls destroyed. This damage was consistent with tornado intensities of approximately 160 mph. EF-3 damage of 145 to 155 mph was also identified with a small number of structures along Farm to Market Road 906 near Midcity, as well as with a residence along Farm to Market Road 2820 west-northwest of Paris. Primary damage to these structures was the total loss of roofs and large-scale interior and exterior wall failure. EF-2 damage, consistent with winds of 111 to 135 mph, was identified with a number of other structures along the tornado s path. Structures with this degree of damage had either all or large portions of their roofs destroyed or significantly damaged, with some wall failures. Widespread EF-1 damage was also apparent all along the track from Brookston to east of Arthur City, as evidenced by trees uprooted, power poles snapped, outbuildings severely damaged, and/or wood frame homes with serious roof damage. This tornado developed in Lamar County, Texas and produced EF-3\ndamage at several locations west through north of Paris, Texas, and\nthen crossed the Red River into Choctaw County. Extensive tree damage\noccurred just north of the Red River with numerous hardwood trees\nsnapped from the E2150 Rd to the E2140 Rd. The tornado moved\nnortheast, becoming about a mile wide several miles south of Sawyer,\nand continued to produce a very wide damage swath until a couple\nmiles north of Highway 70. Throughout the path, numerous trees were\nsnapped and uprooted, numerous power poles were snapped, numerous\noutbuildings were destroyed, and a number of homes were damaged. The\ntornado dissipated between the N 4340 Rd and N 4360 Rd, and south of\nthe E 1980 Rd.", "F_scale": 4, "Wind": 170, "Source": null, "State_1": "TX", "State_2": "OK", "State_3": null, "SPC_id": null, "NCEI_id": null }, "geometry": { "type": "LineString", "coordinates": [ [ -95.749036096, 33.599460692 ], [ -95.745857518, 33.604525982 ], [ -95.741995137, 33.609422665 ], [ -95.73366956, 33.619286671 ], [ -95.717510399, 33.638609798 ], [ -95.701760468, 33.652507292 ], [ -95.695366081, 33.658687205 ], [ -95.688737195, 33.664589403 ], [ -95.675753769, 33.676188596 ], [ -95.66444711, 33.686446229 ], [ -95.658610623, 33.692052396 ], [ -95.652945798, 33.696872692 ], [ -95.642122022, 33.709117195 ], [ -95.630775765, 33.721626155 ], [ -95.622383979, 33.732773706 ], [ -95.618221191, 33.73919766 ], [ -95.614401725, 33.74544271 ], [ -95.603481606, 33.756885181 ], [ -95.555224255, 33.804969907 ], [ -95.530676679, 33.829072612 ], [ -95.523638562, 33.83663005 ], [ -95.518593401, 33.843324557 ], [ -95.513636679, 33.84681759 ], [ -95.506383986, 33.851647007 ], [ -95.499045462, 33.85651179 ], [ -95.492629618, 33.860396289 ], [ -95.477976636, 33.874834784 ], [ -95.469200448, 33.882245663 ], [ -95.463683219, 33.888045967 ], [ -95.457884952979327, 33.896001938121351 ], [ -95.448658153502436, 33.906616542810532 ], [ -95.418917819945307, 33.939378415556583 ], [ -95.394069835631342, 33.964546515928539 ], [ -95.359222576109858, 34.00866732312921 ], [ -95.340854808775873, 34.031933523105415 ], [ -95.310856983153315, 34.064042284475597 ], [ -95.307938739745111, 34.069481849061283 ], [ -95.301501438109369, 34.08924197344664 ], [ -95.296394512145014, 34.112379051135811 ], [ -95.294162914244623, 34.116145267473492 ] ] } },

An aerial survey confirmed that the tornado damage was to tin metal roof panels that were peeled off of a plant on CR-1200. As the tornado continued, near FM-411, a single family home had all of its walls removed with only the interior room left standing where a family of three sheltered where winds were estimated at 150 mph. This location is where the strongest confirmed winds are currently along the tornado s path. After it crossed FM-411, it hit another single family home and collapsed all the walls, injuring a woman who left their vehicle to take shelter inside the home. The tornado continued on to CR-1275 where debarking of a few trees was first observed in addition to thousands of trees that were snapped and uprooted throughout the path of the tornado. It then crossed US-82, CR-2123, CR-2124, and FM-2283. At FM-2283, it destroyed a single family home along with several outbuildings. The home could not be surveyed at this location as debris removal had already begun. The tornado then continued to move along CR-2125 and CR-2030 before taking a more eastward jog across SH-37. At this point, it is estimated that it was about a third of a mile wide and it began to widen further as it demonstrated more widespread tree snaps and isolated debarking throughout the remainder of Red River County, TX. After crossing SH-37, the tornado wiped a single family home off of its foundation north of Clarksville with large portions of the walls and roof carried several hundred yards northeast of the home. This damage was surrounded by widespread tree snaps with isolated debarking. This location along with widespread tree damage downstream are being reviewed by a regional Quick Response Team (QRT) as damage may be greater than EF-3, but is currently rated EF-3 at 140 mph at this time. 10 people on the property of the home wiped off its foundation took shelter in an oil drain of a metal outbuilding that was completely destroyed with no injuries. The damage swath widened to at least 0.4 miles northeast of Clarksville as it approached Acworth and continued to cross the Red River. Before it crossed the Red River, it lifted a double wide manufactured home off the ground near FM-1159 and threw it 50 yards with three dogs in it that all survived. There were several more structures in the Acworth community that were destroyed, but have not been analyzed from the ground at this time.
