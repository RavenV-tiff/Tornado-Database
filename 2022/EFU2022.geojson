This tornado was associated with the line segment that was moving through the area roughly 25 minutes after the intial tornado producing supercell. During the initial storm survey there were several discrepancies noted in the overall damage path that did not quite line up with the initial tornado path including snapped/uprooted trees by a pond and the damage done to the southern portion of the chicken houses. Given the overlapping paths and likely similar start points, it is impossible to determine what the true intensity, path width, path length, and end point of this tornado was. The beginning time of the tornado is estimated by radar and third party pressure data.
