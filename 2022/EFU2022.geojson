It evolved into a cluster of cells initially before splitting off into an individual supercell that would develop rotation as it moved out of southeastern Montgomery County into northwestern Prince Georges County. The cell dropped a tornado earlier in the afternoon near Bowie, and would then cycle to produce the second tornado in Harwood.
