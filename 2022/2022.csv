A family of 5 inside the mobile home were all injured, with a couple receiving critical injuries. Another injury occurred farther downstream from this area but this injury was not critical. In addition to damage to residences, there were scores of farms and outbuildings which were generally destroyed, with casualties of at least two horses.
This tornado was quite anomalous for its above average width in relation to its relatively short path length. There were a few EF-2 damage points associated with extreme swaths of tree damage, although little tree debarking was seen.

The tornado began to intensify and develop a widespread damage swath of uprooted and snapped trees as it approached Highway 271 several miles south of Gilmer. Prior to reaching Highway 271, the tornado ripped the roof off of a single family home and tore down a wall of the home. As the tornado continued on, it reached its maximum width of 700 yards or 0.4 miles as it crossed Highway 700. The tornado intensified further as it crossed Azalea Road and Highway 154. Just before reaching this road, the tornado hit a two-story single family home, removing the home's second floor and tearing down a front exterior wall. This led to the tornado's estimated maximum wind speed of 135 mph, the strongest EF-2 rating on the Enhanced Fujita Scale. A nearby mobile home was also destroyed, with an occupant injured.
The tornado continued to track northeast and ripped off a roof of a single family home, and completely destroyed one double-wide and multiple single-wide manufactured homes. The tornado also led to structural damage to several two-story family homes with portions of the roofs removed and a projectile leading to a large hole in the side of a home. A guest house that had a frame nailed into the ground was wiped clean from its foundation with its occupant hospitalized.
As the tornado continued to track northeast, it led to more structural damage to single family homes and complete destruction to manufactured homes between Gilmer and Ore City. On at least three occasions, manufactured homes had residents inside of them when they were picked up and thrown by the tornado. Additional widespread tree and roof damage to homes continued as the tornado approached Lake O' the Pines. Before crossing the lake into Western Marion County, the tornado ripped the roof off of the Lake O' the Pines Bait Shop before throwing multiple RV's and a motor home into the lake. Four occupants in these RV's were injured but were rescued from the lake. This is a continuation of the Upshur County EF-2 tornado. This tornado, which had weakened to an EF-1 with estimated maximum winds near 110 mph as it entered far Western Marion County, continued to track northeast across Jordan Drive and FM 729. The tornado damaged the roof of a home on Jordan Drive, with a metal building structure for storage of vehicles having two walls and its roof removed, lifting pillars and throwing them several hundred feet. Widespread tree damage was observed with hundreds of snapped trees. Off of FM 729, a manufactured home was picked up and rolled with an occupant in it. She suffered injuries and walked nearly a half mile to FM 729 to get to help. The tornado also significantly damaged or destroyed manufactured homes along Nash Farm Road. Winds from this tornado also caused three wooden power poles to lean significantly off of Morris County Cutoff Road, before the tornado crossed over into extreme Southeast Morris County. This is a continuation of the Upshur/Marion County EF-2 tornado. This tornado, which remained an EF-1 with estimated maximum winds near 110 mph from far Western Marion County, snapped numerous trees in far Southeast Morris County along and east of Morris County Cutoff Road/County Road 2307, before entering Southwestern Cass County. This is a continuation of the Upshur/Western Marion/Southeast Morris County EF-2 tornado. This tornado, which maintained an EF-1 rating with estimated maximum winds around 105 mph, continued to uproot and snap trees and Southwest and Central Cass County with damage becoming more sporadic and narrow as it tracked northeast across FM 161, County Road 1599, Highway 49, County Road 1577, Highway 11, before finally lifting just east of Highway 130.

The house had additional strapping directly into the foundation, as well as strapping from the cinder blocks to the foundation. The house itself held together but was shifted about 50 yards to the north and rotated about 90 degrees. The house next door was also swept off the foundation, moved and mostly destroyed. This also had some evidence of strapping to the slab foundation. This area is what will justify the 160 MPH EF3 rating. Most if not all houses on the south to north path within a 4 block west to east range received minor to substantial roof damage with many houses seeing walls collapsed, leaving interior rooms intact.

At this area significant tree damage was observed with several large mature oak trees uprooted. The damage in this area was rated EF1. The tornado continued east and crossed CR228 where more tree damage was seen. The tornado turned toward the east-northeast and likely remained on the ground east of CR228 (Doppler radar indicated a tornado debris signature). After approximately 1.3 miles the storm turned back to the east before it neared the Williamson/Bell County line about 0.15 miles west-northwest of CR231 in far northern Williamson County. A mobile home was shifted off its foundation at this location on the county line and multiple large oak trees were snapped and uprooted. This damage was also rated EF1. While in Williamson County this tornado had a maximum width of 500 yards and maximum winds of near 100 mph with a path length of 3.54 miles. This tornado began in northern Williamson County and additional information about the beginning of this tornado track can be found from the NWS Austin/San Antonio office.
Video evidence taken on the ground during the tornadic event, and areal footage of the damage track show the parent circulation produced at least 3 small, brief tornadoes while the storm circulation was near and east of the county line. Scattered damage points and small paths are making it difficult to determine which areas may have been impacted by each of these smaller tornadoes before the parent tornado formed. Therefore, in the area just east of the Williamson/Bell County line, the damage extent of the tornadic track has been widened to include all the known damage points (all EF-0s or EF-1s). In this case, since it is too difficult to discern the smaller tracks, and because they all formed from the same parent circulation within a short amount of time of each other, they will all be considered one tornado. The maximum width listed will remain the maximum width of the parent tornado (the EF-3 tornado).
The tornado, which began in northern Williamson County, entered extreme southern Bell County north of the junction between Bell County Road 231 and FM 2843. In this area there was a narrow swath of tree damage consistent with EF-0 intensity wind speeds, with some damage to outbuildings as well. The tornado moved east-northeast and intersected FM 2843, where the damage to trees and structures became much more significant. At least 15-20 damaged homes were visible to the survey team on both sides of FM 2843, with the most significant damage concentrated near the junction of FM 2843 and Buttermilk Road. In this vicinity, at least 10 structures suffered EF-2 to EF-3 intensity damage, with a small cluster of homes experiencing estimated peak tornado wind speeds of 150 to 165 mph. These structures had all or most of their roofs removed, and some of them had one or more exterior walls collapsed. Two churches along FM 2843 in the vicinity of Buttermilk Road were seriously damaged, with roofing material removed and multiple walls collapsed. Numerous vehicles in the area had significant damage consistent with being rolled or having flying projectiles thrown into them. Many hardwood trees along the FM 2843 corridor in the tornado path were uprooted or snapped, and many power poles were also snapped.
Beyond Buttermilk Road, the tornado continued traveling east-northeastward another 1.5 miles along FM 2843, then began a sharp turn to the northeast and eventually a northerly direction. Aerial footage allowed us to track the damage through inaccessible areas where notable tree damage, damage to homes and barns was observed along the path of the tornado.
The tornado reached Crows Ranch Rd and damaged aluminum panels of the roof of a home and blew in the panel garage door. It continued over a ridge line, then intensified again shortly before crossing FM 2484. It uprooted many large trees, shifted a large barn's walls, lifted roof panels off a shed, and caused significant damage to a residence. The residence's roof was almost entirely removed from the structure, and a section of the south facing wall was blown in. The east facing wall was completely blown out, all consistent with a high-end EF2 rating in this location.

It was determined that a brief EF-1 tornado that was embedded within a larger area of straight-line winds touched down 1.3 miles southeast of Upton, traveled east for just over 2.5 miles, and then lifted 3 miles east-southeast of Upton. The EF-1 tornado had a max wind of around 100 mph, and a max path width of around 200 yards.
The tornado touched down at solid EF-1 strength just northwest of the intersection of Weldon Loop Road and Watkins Alvey Road where a small barn was completely destroyed, and debris was scattered in many directions almost a half mile to the northeast. In addition, a small lean-to section of another barn was thrown back to the northwest, clear evidence of cyclonic rotation. Hardwood trees just downstream from the barn were also snapped and laying in a convergent pattern, offering more support for tornadic winds.
The tornado continued roughly eastward along Weldon Loop Road where it did some light damage to a barn roof and brought down large limbs from a hardwood tree. This damage occurred near the intersection of Johnson Road and Weldon Loop Road, and was in the EF-0 strength range. The tornado continued to the ENE along Weldon Loop Road at EF- 0 strength as it caused minor roof damage to a house, and damaged a greenhouse near the intersection of Wheeler and Wheldon Loop Roads. The tornado finished the last half mile of its path along Upton Talley Road where it uprooted or snapped softwood trees, damaged barns, and did minor fascia and shingle damage to a couple of homes. The tornado lifted about a quarter mile past the Upton Talley and Lanny Heath Roads intersection.
It should be noted that this brief tornado occurred within a larger area of straight-line wind damage where some older barns were destroyed and numerous softwood and hardwood trees were snapped or uprooted. However, the damage was mainly laying in an east-northeast direction consistent with overall storm motion and a straight-line wind signature. It was considered to make this damage part of the overall tornado, however the path width would have been over a half mile wide, which is unlikely for brief spin-up tornadoes embedded in a QLCS.
It should also be noted that more sporadic, and overall weaker, straight-line wind damage continued eastward along a consistent path across southern Larue county.

The first damage noted was along Barterbrook Road one-half mile north of Tinkling Spring Road where there were broken tree branches and both hardwood and softwood trees were snapped. As the tornado progressed east, additional trees were snapped and uprooted along with significant damage to a farm on the 1100 block of Tinkling Spring Road. At this farm, significant roof and structural damage was observed to a barn. A farmhouse lost portions of its metal roof which became dislodged and were wrapped around branches of a tree. Lumber from the barn was lofted approximately 125 yards and embedded into the ground in different directions. Trees on the farm were noted to be snapped in multiple directions.

Some screens were also damaged on homes and some siding was dislodged at this location. The tornado crossed Tinkling Spring Road where additional hardwood trees were uprooted and softwood trees were snapped. Siding and roof damage occurred to a mobile home and two 75-yard sections of fence were blown inward at a plumbing supply facility. A trash dumpster and grease dumpster were flipped sideways, and minor structural damage was observed to an office complex near the intersection of Tinkling Spring Road and Ivy Ridge Road.

The tornado first entered the extreme southwestern corner of Knox County at 940 PM EST and proceeded to cause damage consistent with EF0/EF1 intensity: snapping two hardwood trees that fell onto power lines on South 1300 West at 13.4 miles west, breaking large hardwood tree branches on South County Road 1300 West at 18.3 miles south, and leaning two utility poles on South 1200 West at 19.9 miles south.
The tornado's center track then crossed the Knox-Gibson county line 4 times over a 1.4-mile segment roughly midway between Mt. Carmel, IL and Hazleton, IN before re-entering Knox County to cause damage consistent with EF0 intensity during 944-949 PM EST: breaking small hardwood tree limbs on South County Road 775 West at 18.6 miles south; and then along the 17.8 South parallel, blowing over 5 irrigation sections at 8.7 miles west, before blowing over two more irrigation sections and blowing in a barn door and tree damage at 8.1 miles west; and then breaking large hardwood tree branches along South County Road 775 West at both 17.0 miles south and 16.55 miles south.
The tornado track then entered the appendage of Gibson County west of Hazleton, IN for 0.5 miles before again re-entering Knox County to cause damage consistent with EF1 intensity at 952 PM EST: leaning utility poles and snapping several tree branches on West County Road 1750 South just west of Old US Route 41.
The tornado track then entered Gibson County for the final time while transecting the appendage north of Hazleton, IN for 1.0 miles before re-entering Knox County for the final time to cause damage consistent with EF0/EF1 intensity at 954 PM EST in the town of Decker, IN: uprooting large hardwood trees along Broadway Street near 3rd Street, with large hardwood branches snapped across southern and eastern portions of Decker.
The tornado continued to the northeast, next causing damage consistent with EF0/EF1 intensity during 955-959 PM EST: snapping branches of various sizes from both softwood and hardwood trees along Indiana Route 241 and East County Road 1250 South to the west of Iona, IN; as well as destroying an old barn on East 1250 South just east of South Decker Road by lifting the roof which allowed the walls to collapse.
The tornado's final observed damage was consistent with EF1 intensity during 1000-1003 PM EST : snapping several softwood trees on South Hart Road just northwest of Upper River Deshee, and fully destroying a barn on Southeast County Road 200 East east of Upper River Deshee, scattering debris several hundred feet to the northeast.

The tornado began along Line Road on the border between Strathmore Township and Hazlet Township where several large limbs were blown off and a couple softwood tree trunks were snapped. The snapped tree trunks caused collateral damage to utility poles and power lines near the intersection of Sophia Drive. The center of circulation continued east-northeast into a residential neighborhood between Sophia Drive and Carlow Way where the most significant damage from the tornado occurred. At least a dozen homes in this area sustained cosmetic damage, including vinyl siding blown off, soffit damage, gutter damage, and/or roof shingles blown off. The only structural damage noted was due to a tree falling onto a home which caused some structural damage to its roof. A few larger softwood trees were uprooted in the residential area and several vinyl fence sections were blown over.
The tornado damage path then became somewhat discontinuous as it crossed the Garden State Parkway toward another residential area along Park View Drive. A softwood tree sustained significant loss of limbs and a couple others were uprooted nearby. A utility pole was also damaged along Park View Drive. A few homes sustained minor cosmetic damage near the intersections of Linda Place, Beers Street, and Rutgers Street, then the circulation continued east-northeast along Rutgers Street toward Bedle Road where several large limbs were blown off a few trees. A final softwood tree was uprooted along Bedle Road near Indian Hill Court where the surface circulation appeared to have dissipated.
No additional damage occurred from this storm as it continued through the residential area toward Route 35. Four utility poles were pushed over or broken along Route 35 near the Jiffy Lube auto shop. However, no additional damage occurred in this area, and thus it has been determined that the damage to the poles was caused by straight line winds.",0,85,NWS Storm Survey,NJ,,,,1017159,Tornado,QLCS,-74.21072819,40.41495421,-74.1963301,40.41851563

The tornado then tracked north-northwest, crossing CR-34 and directly hitting an open-walled chicken house. While most of the roof was damaged, the open walls allowed for the tornado to more easily loft portions of the roof and cause damage to metal roofing panels, so a lower-end estimate of 70 mph was given. This was the maximum width identifiable in the damage pattern for the weak tornado, as roughly two-thirds of the building had roof damage. The tornado then continued north-northwest, uprooting a few trees before rapidly lifting. Due to waterlogged soils from antecedent heavy rainfall, a low-end wind estimate of 73 mph was provided for the uprooted trees.

The tornado continued to track northeast causing tree damage along Chappelear Drive around Mount Wolf Road. Damage was more sporadic across this area, but a large softwood tree was uprooted and a tree fell onto a house. Witness statements along with the survey noted that most of the damage on Chappelear Drive was around two or three houses. Most of the trees were facing south to north, which when compared to the location of the damage along White Road, shows counterclockwise rotation.
Damage to the north and east was sporadic, but there were several areas that could not be accessed to survey. The tornado continued into Charles County. A tornado touched down near the Saint Mary's and Charles County line between MD-5 Leonardtown Road and MD-231 Prince Frederick Road. The tornado tracked from around Charlotte Hall to near Benedict during the evening of Friday, May 27, 2022.
After crossing into Charles County from Saint Mary's County, there were several large branches down along MD-231 Prince Frederick Road between Barney Drive and Colonial Drive.

The origin of this severe thunderstorm was the result of a cell merger of two separate thunderstorms that approached Saint Mary's County: one crossing eastward over the Potomac River from near Quantico in Virginia moving toward Charles County, Maryland; and the other one crossing northeast over the Potomac River near Colonial Beach. The cells merged over Charles County between La Plata and Dentsville, then proceeded due east toward northern Saint Mary's County where the tornado occurred.
The severe thunderstorm damaged over two dozen trees and large branches in an approximately three mile radius of the intersection of MD-5 Point Lookout Road and MD-235 Three Notch Road. Most of this damage was sporadic and isolated in areal extent, but included tree trunk snapps and uproots, with estimated wind speeds between 60 and 70 MPH based on the observed tree damage. However, there were two areas of more concentrated damage that helped lead to the determination of a tornado in this area of southern Maryland.
The tornado initially touched down around an enclave of residential houses 200 yards southwest of the intersection of MD-5 and MD-235. Here, there was a mix of about a dozen uprooted and trunk snaps of both hardwood and softwood trees. One of the trees fell onto the roof of a residence, causing roof damage; fortunately, there were no injuries despite a resident being inside the home when it fell. The trees fell to the north, east, southeast, east, west, and northwest. Due to the localized but prolific damage in this enclave, wind estimates are up to 85 MPH. It is believed that the tornado went right over this enclave of residences due to the random direction of tree falls.
The tornado may have lifted as it moved to the east-northeast. However, tornadic damage was noted about 3 miles further east along Delabrooke Road, where a chaotic mix of downed trees and branches were observed on both sides of the 40900 block in a deeply forested area. Residents in this area received the mobile phone alert before the damage occurred, and also reported half dollar size hail.

Based on analysis of the storm survey findings and OKX dual pol radar reflectivity, velocity and derived data (including a tornadic debris signature), it was determined that an EF0 tornado first touched down at Juniper Hill farms around 1117 pm, damaging a greenhouse and downing a couple of large trees on the property.
The tornadic circulation likely lifted or skipped along as it tracked east northeast across a one mile stretch of remote wooded area, before touching down and shearing several tree tops and large limbs in the vicinity of Cottage Way, Walnut Place, and Lipco Road, between Sound Avenue and Old Sound Avenue. Peripheral straight line wind damage to a large tree was noted near Shirley Road and Horton Avenue to the north of Sound Avenue as well.

A National Weather Service survey team assessed tornado damage across Lamar County, Texas in the wake of storms which occurred Friday afternoon, November 4th. A tornado formed near Brookston in western Lamar County and tracked rapidly northeastward, passing to the northwest of Paris, Texas before exiting the northern edge of Lamar County, east of Arthur City. The exact length of the tornado is not yet pinpointed, but is believed to be at least 20 miles in length. The tornado continued into Choctaw County in far southeast Oklahoma, and the track in that county is being surveyed by personnel from NWS Tulsa. Several dozen individual homes, businesses and outbuildings were impacted across western and northern Lamar County. Damage consistent with EF-3 intensity tornadic winds of 150-160 mph were identified at several locations west through north of Paris. In particular, several residences along Farm Market Road 1499 northwest of Paris were completely unroofed, with most external and internal walls destroyed. This damage was consistent with tornado intensities of approximately 160 mph. EF-3 damage of 145 to 155 mph was also identified with a small number of structures along Farm to Market Road 906 near Midcity, as well as with a residence along Farm to Market Road 2820 west-northwest of Paris. Primary damage to these structures was the total loss of roofs and large-scale interior and exterior wall failure. EF-2 damage, consistent with winds of 111 to 135 mph, was identified with a number of other structures along the tornado s path. Structures with this degree of damage had either all or large portions of their roofs destroyed or significantly damaged, with some wall failures. Widespread EF-1 damage was also apparent all along the track from Brookston to east of Arthur City, as evidenced by trees uprooted, power poles snapped, outbuildings severely damaged, and/or wood frame homes with serious roof damage. This tornado developed in Lamar County, Texas and produced EF-3
damage at several locations west through north of Paris, Texas, and
then crossed the Red River into Choctaw County. Extensive tree damage
occurred just north of the Red River with numerous hardwood trees
snapped from the E2150 Rd to the E2140 Rd. The tornado moved
northeast, becoming about a mile wide several miles south of Sawyer,
and continued to produce a very wide damage swath until a couple
miles north of Highway 70. Throughout the path, numerous trees were
snapped and uprooted, numerous power poles were snapped, numerous
outbuildings were destroyed, and a number of homes were damaged. The

The original storm survey found the tornado moved northeast into Hughes Springs, where EF-1 damage was noted. Two single family residences sustained damage to the roofs with partial roof damage. The forest station on Pine Street also sustained damage to the roof and walls. Additionally, numerous large trees were downed along the path. Further surveying found greater damage along County Road 2994, just NE of Hughes Springs. Here, two well built homes sustained substantial roof damage consistent with an EF2 rating as the tornado continued on its path. The tornado continued doing EF1 damage through the countryside of Cass County, with a consistent path of snapped and uprooted soft and hardwood trees. The tornado began to intensify near Cusseta, TX, with some of the better tornado debris signature appearing on radar. Here, the tornado did widespread EF2 damage to countless hardwood and softwood trees. Trees were snapped and twisted over an extensive area of ground, with the tornado doing EF1 damage to an old structure located on a small hill down the road. The tornado began to wind down on the north side of Texas Highway 77 west of Douglassville, but not before snapping more hard and softwood trees on both sides of the highway.

Here there were also two non-critical injuries. The tornado then tracked over a small portion of the lake again before coming ashore and moving across Corney Creek drive and Dozier road. In this area there were several residences damaged by falling trees, although one cabin was largely destroyed due to what seemed to be a combination of falling trees and wind forcing.

The tornado touched down as an EF0 along Dry Creek Road where a few trees were uprooted. The next available road was along County Road 31 where significant tree damage occurred to the north of Frankville. Numerous trees were snapped or uprooted in a 120 yard swath. Significant snapping and deforestation seemed evident looking further southwest along the track; however, this area was inaccessible at the time and required satellite data to confirm the degree of damage. Update 12/18/22: Our first sentinel satellite imagery pass was this afternoon and cleared up the details of how this tornado evolved. The first major change was to the intensity of the tornado. Complete deforestation of trees to the southwest of County Road 31 was noted on satellite imagery, indicating numerous if not all trees in the path were uprooted/snapped low at their base. Based on this, the intensity is bumped to 130mph making this a high-end EF2. The next major change is to end the tornado just northeast of County Road 31. Sentinel satellite imagery indicates the tornado occluded to the left rather abruptly, and reached its widest point of 140 yards as it once again produced EF2 damage with widespread deforestation during the occlusion process. The damage path ends abruptly once the tornado was moving due north on satellite imagery. It's possible it continued to travel to the north for a bit while weakening, however, based on the storm survey on Blue Dirt Road it never reached the road.

A remarkable gradient at the point of genesis was noted by the survey team in a field of snapped/uprooted trees, where trees went from untouched to numerous snaps of softwood trees in as little as 5 to 10 feet.
