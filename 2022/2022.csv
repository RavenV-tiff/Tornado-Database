The roof of a manufactured home was damaged partially due to wind and snapped trees. The manufactured home was shifted off its foundation and the nearby carport and shed were heavily damaged. The tornado went on to lift the metal roof off the back end of a nearby home. This resulted in substantial loss of its roofing. In addition, the force of the wind moving through the home pushed the front walls outward and blew out the front windows and part of the roof frame. The debris from the home was lofted into the tops of the trees across the road, with metal wrapped around trees.

The most intense damage was from the riverbank to the canal in Arabi. It was a very narrow, intense tornado with two areas of concentrated EF3 damage. One was a house that was swept off its raised foundation with all walls and the roof destroyed. This was near where the one fatality occurred. Due to poor construction, this was EF3. The highest EF3 rating was given to a house that was constructed in the last 6 months. While this house was raised on cinder blocks, every tower of blocks had strapping to the house. The house had additional strapping directly into the foundation, as well as strapping from the cinder blocks to the foundation. The house itself held together but was shifted about 50 yards to the north and rotated about 90 degrees. The house next door was also swept off the foundation, moved and mostly destroyed. This also had some evidence of strapping to the slab foundation. This area is what will justify the 160 MPH EF3 rating. Most if not all houses on the south to north path within a 4 block west to east range received minor to substantial roof damage with many houses seeing walls collapsed, leaving interior rooms intact.

One chicken house collapsed with minor tree damage and tin strewn in the treeline just to the northeast. It then crossed B&D Road, where a small storage outbuilding was completely destroyed, a chicken house had loss of tin roofing and increasing tree damage occurred. It then continued northeast across Prairie Point Road. A tornado debris signature was evident on radar just northeast of B&D Road and just south of Prairie Point Road. The tornado became nearly the widest at this point, around a quarter of a mile wide. Three power poles were snapped, and tree damage intensified. In this area, the tornado increased to EF-2 intensity. Many softwood trees were snapped nearly halfway down the trunks. A residential home roof uplift occurred, with a large portion of the roof missing and the eastern wall removed. A tin metal storage building s wall panels were removed. Just northeast of this building, another open metal storage building was completely destroyed. At this area of the home and open metal storage building, moderate EF-2 damage was observed, and the highest rating of around 130-135 mph was assigned. Some concrete pillars were moved, with one completely removed and missing. These concrete pillars were rebared into a steel plate a few feet below ground.

From here, the tornado weakened a bit as it approached Alligator road. The tornado was near its peak width at this time, then striking a more residential area along Carver road. Here, one mobile home was completely destroyed, with a home having its roof completely removed and some partial wall collapses. On either side of the center of the track, other homes sustained different degrees of damage to their roofs and siding. The tornado continued northeastward and maintained EF2 strength, primarily causing damage to trees. Much of the damage on Macedonia Church Rd was from trees falling on homes. The tornado showed signs of weakening by this point as it approached Orangeburg county, and it is distinctly possible that there were multiple weak vortexes impacting only the tops of trees. EF0 and weak EF1 damage was noted until the county line with Orangeburg. A National Weather Service survey team confirmed a tornado that began in eastern Allendale County, moved across Bamberg County, and then crossed into Orangeburg County just north of Hwy 78. At its strongest, the tornado was an EF3 in Bamberg County, but produced EF1 damage in Orangeburg County. In Orangeburg County, the tornado approached the North Fork of the Edisto river and impacted a couple of homes, resulting in significant tree damage on both properties. As the tornado approached Freedom Road in Orangeburg County, it produced EF0 and EF1 damage as it continued to snap trees. The tornado continued to weaken gradually as it approached Bowman, finally dissipating about 2 miles north of the town.",3,160,NWS Storm Survey,SC,,,621287,"1014514, 1011033, 1011034",Tornado,Supercell

At this area significant tree damage was observed with several large mature oak trees uprooted. The damage in this area was rated EF1. The tornado continued east and crossed CR228 where more tree damage was seen. The tornado turned toward the east-northeast and likely remained on the ground east of CR228 (Doppler radar indicated a tornado debris signature). After approximately 1.3 miles the storm turned back to the east before it neared the Williamson/Bell County line about 0.15 miles west-northwest of CR231 in far northern Williamson County. A mobile home was shifted off its foundation at this location on the county line and multiple large oak trees were snapped and uprooted. This damage was also rated EF1. While in Williamson County this tornado had a maximum width of 500 yards and maximum winds of near 100 mph with a path length of 3.54 miles. This tornado began in northern Williamson County and additional information about the beginning of this tornado track can be found from the NWS Austin/San Antonio office.
Video evidence taken on the ground during the tornadic event, and areal footage of the damage track show the parent circulation produced at least 3 small, brief tornadoes while the storm circulation was near and east of the county line. Scattered damage points and small paths are making it difficult to determine which areas may have been impacted by each of these smaller tornadoes before the parent tornado formed. Therefore, in the area just east of the Williamson/Bell County line, the damage extent of the tornadic track has been widened to include all the known damage points (all EF-0s or EF-1s). In this case, since it is too difficult to discern the smaller tracks, and because they all formed from the same parent circulation within a short amount of time of each other, they will all be considered one tornado. The maximum width listed will remain the maximum width of the parent tornado (the EF-3 tornado).
The tornado, which began in northern Williamson County, entered extreme southern Bell County north of the junction between Bell County Road 231 and FM 2843. In this area there was a narrow swath of tree damage consistent with EF-0 intensity wind speeds, with some damage to outbuildings as well. The tornado moved east-northeast and intersected FM 2843, where the damage to trees and structures became much more significant. At least 15-20 damaged homes were visible to the survey team on both sides of FM 2843, with the most significant damage concentrated near the junction of FM 2843 and Buttermilk Road. In this vicinity, at least 10 structures suffered EF-2 to EF-3 intensity damage, with a small cluster of homes experiencing estimated peak tornado wind speeds of 150 to 165 mph. These structures had all or most of their roofs removed, and some of them had one or more exterior walls collapsed. Two churches along FM 2843 in the vicinity of Buttermilk Road were seriously damaged, with roofing material removed and multiple walls collapsed. Numerous vehicles in the area had significant damage consistent with being rolled or having flying projectiles thrown into them. Many hardwood trees along the FM 2843 corridor in the tornado path were uprooted or snapped, and many power poles were also snapped.
Beyond Buttermilk Road, the tornado continued traveling east-northeastward another 1.5 miles along FM 2843, then began a sharp turn to the northeast and eventually a northerly direction. Aerial footage allowed us to track the damage through inaccessible areas where notable tree damage, damage to homes and barns was observed along the path of the tornado.
The tornado reached Crows Ranch Rd and damaged aluminum panels of the roof of a home and blew in the panel garage door. It continued over a ridge line, then intensified again shortly before crossing FM 2484. It uprooted many large trees, shifted a large barn's walls, lifted roof panels off a shed, and caused significant damage to a residence. The residence's roof was almost entirely removed from the structure, and a section of the south facing wall was blown in. The east facing wall was completely blown out, all consistent with a high-end EF2 rating in this location. The tornado then continued northwest into the South Shore neighborhood, and then into Union Grove Park where it lifted shortly after moving onto Stillhouse Hollow Lake.",3,165,NWS Storm Survey,TX,,,621315,"1021318, 1022969",Tornado,Supercell

It was determined that a brief EF-1 tornado that was embedded within a larger area of straight-line winds touched down 1.3 miles southeast of Upton, traveled east for just over 2.5 miles, and then lifted 3 miles east-southeast of Upton. The EF-1 tornado had a max wind of around 100 mph, and a max path width of around 200 yards.
The tornado touched down at solid EF-1 strength just northwest of the intersection of Weldon Loop Road and Watkins Alvey Road where a small barn was completely destroyed, and debris was scattered in many directions almost a half mile to the northeast. In addition, a small lean-to section of another barn was thrown back to the northwest, clear evidence of cyclonic rotation. Hardwood trees just downstream from the barn were also snapped and laying in a convergent pattern, offering more support for tornadic winds.
The tornado continued roughly eastward along Weldon Loop Road where it did some light damage to a barn roof and brought down large limbs from a hardwood tree. This damage occurred near the intersection of Johnson Road and Weldon Loop Road, and was in the EF-0 strength range. The tornado continued to the ENE along Weldon Loop Road at EF- 0 strength as it caused minor roof damage to a house, and damaged a greenhouse near the intersection of Wheeler and Wheldon Loop Roads. The tornado finished the last half mile of its path along Upton Talley Road where it uprooted or snapped softwood trees, damaged barns, and did minor fascia and shingle damage to a couple of homes. The tornado lifted about a quarter mile past the Upton Talley and Lanny Heath Roads intersection.
It should be noted that this brief tornado occurred within a larger area of straight-line wind damage where some older barns were destroyed and numerous softwood and hardwood trees were snapped or uprooted. However, the damage was mainly laying in an east-northeast direction consistent with overall storm motion and a straight-line wind signature. It was considered to make this damage part of the overall tornado, however the path width would have been over a half mile wide, which is unlikely for brief spin-up tornadoes embedded in a QLCS.
It should also be noted that more sporadic, and overall weaker, straight-line wind damage continued eastward along a consistent path across southern Larue county. Most of this damage was consistent with winds between 60 and 70 mph toward and just north of the Magnolia community and points eastward.",1,100,NWS Storm Survey,KY,,,621358,"1022463",Tornado,QLCS

There was more extensive damage to the roofing structures of several homes. One house in particular had wind enter its roof soffit, blowing building material out the western side. The house insulation was thrown around three sides of the home. Wind speeds in this area were estimated to be 97 mph with a width of 125 yards. A Ford Ranger, parked in another driveway was picked up and slid 11 yards, with house insulation on three sides of the truck.
There were several road signs twisted and mangled too. The tornado continued towards the entrance of the Glenmary Reserves subdivision off Bardstown Road.

As the tornado progressed east, additional trees were snapped and uprooted along with significant damage to a farm on the 1100 block of Tinkling Spring Road. At this farm, significant roof and structural damage was observed to a barn. A farmhouse lost portions of its metal roof which became dislodged and were wrapped around branches of a tree. Lumber from the barn was lofted approximately 125 yards and embedded into the ground in different directions. Trees on the farm were noted to be snapped in multiple directions. The tornado continued eastward towards the intersection of Tinkling Spring Road and Ramsey Road where more hardwood tree branches and entire softwood trees were snapped. Some screens were also damaged on homes and some siding was dislodged at this location. The tornado crossed Tinkling Spring Road where additional hardwood trees were uprooted and softwood trees were snapped. Siding and roof damage occurred to a mobile home and two 75-yard sections of fence were blown inward at a plumbing supply facility. A trash dumpster and grease dumpster were flipped sideways, and minor structural damage was observed to an office complex near the intersection of Tinkling Spring Road and Ivy Ridge Road. Sporadic damage continued near Ivy Ridge road. As the tornado moved east through Ivy Ridge, the tornado produced scattered tree and structural damage throughout the area. The tornado then paralleled Ladd Road and crossed Interstate 64 near Hickory Hill Road. The tornado continued moving east into a wooded area between Hickory Hill Road and Lew Dewitt Boulevard. The survey team noted scattered uprooted and snapped trees.
After this point, the tornado moved into the City of Waynesboro.
It was noted that significant leaf debris occurred on all sides of multiple structures along the entire path of the tornado. While many trees were snapped and/or uprooted along the storm motion (generally west to east), there were a number of tree snaps or uproots in multiple directions along the tornado's path.",1,90,NWS Storm Survey,VA,,,621409,"1011048, 1011052",Tornado,Supercell

Multiple units were completely destroyed with debris blown away from the original locations of the units (DI 4, DOD 12). The second location was the business district of Gaylord where the buildings of Hobby Lobby, Maurices, and Jimmy Johns experienced collapses of exterior walls where interior walls remained standing (DI 10, DOD 8). The last location, which had the highest estimated wind speed of 150 mph, was damage found to homes on Berkshire Ln on the northeast side of Gaylord. Most exterior walls were collapsed and only partial interior walls were left standing (DI 2, DOD 8). The tornado dissipated at 1457 EST about 1.75 miles northeast of Sparr. Two fatalities were reported in the Nottingham Forest community, along with 44 injuries reported from various locations around Gaylord. The maximum path width in Otsego county was 200 yards.",3,150,NWS Storm Survey,MI,,,621574,"1031439, 1031457",Tornado,Supercell

The tornado began along Line Road on the border between Strathmore Township and Hazlet Township where several large limbs were blown off and a couple softwood tree trunks were snapped. The snapped tree trunks caused collateral damage to utility poles and power lines near the intersection of Sophia Drive. The center of circulation continued east-northeast into a residential neighborhood between Sophia Drive and Carlow Way where the most significant damage from the tornado occurred. At least a dozen homes in this area sustained cosmetic damage, including vinyl siding blown off, soffit damage, gutter damage, and/or roof shingles blown off. The only structural damage noted was due to a tree falling onto a home which caused some structural damage to its roof. A few larger softwood trees were uprooted in the residential area and several vinyl fence sections were blown over.
The tornado damage path then became somewhat discontinuous as it crossed the Garden State Parkway toward another residential area along Park View Drive. A softwood tree sustained significant loss of limbs and a couple others were uprooted nearby. A utility pole was also damaged along Park View Drive. A few homes sustained minor cosmetic damage near the intersections of Linda Place, Beers Street, and Rutgers Street, then the circulation continued east-northeast along Rutgers Street toward Bedle Road where several large limbs were blown off a few trees. A final softwood tree was uprooted along Bedle Road near Indian Hill Court where the surface circulation appeared to have dissipated.
No additional damage occurred from this storm as it continued through the residential area toward Route 35. Four utility poles were pushed over or broken along Route 35 near the Jiffy Lube auto shop. However, no additional damage occurred in this area, and thus it has been determined that the damage to the poles was caused by straight line winds.",0,85,NWS Storm Survey,NJ,,,621575,"1017159",Tornado,QLCS

The origin of this severe thunderstorm was the result of a cell merger of two separate thunderstorms that approached Saint Mary's County: one crossing eastward over the Potomac River from near Quantico in Virginia moving toward Charles County, Maryland; and the other one crossing northeast over the Potomac River near Colonial Beach. The cells merged over Charles County between La Plata and Dentsville, then proceeded due east toward northern Saint Mary's County where the tornado occurred.
The severe thunderstorm damaged over two dozen trees and large branches in an approximately three mile radius of the intersection of MD-5 Point Lookout Road and MD-235 Three Notch Road. Most of this damage was sporadic and isolated in areal extent, but included tree trunk snapps and uproots, with estimated wind speeds between 60 and 70 MPH based on the observed tree damage. However, there were two areas of more concentrated damage that helped lead to the determination of a tornado in this area of southern Maryland.
The tornado initially touched down around an enclave of residential houses 200 yards southwest of the intersection of MD-5 and MD-235. Here, there was a mix of about a dozen uprooted and trunk snaps of both hardwood and softwood trees. One of the trees fell onto the roof of a residence, causing roof damage; fortunately, there were no injuries despite a resident being inside the home when it fell. The trees fell to the north, east, southeast, east, west, and northwest. Due to the localized but prolific damage in this enclave, wind estimates are up to 85 MPH. It is believed that the tornado went right over this enclave of residences due to the random direction of tree falls.
The tornado may have lifted as it moved to the east-northeast. However, tornadic damage was noted about 3 miles further east along Delabrooke Road, where a chaotic mix of downed trees and branches were observed on both sides of the 40900 block in a deeply forested area. Residents in this area received the mobile phone alert before the damage occurred, and also reported half dollar size hail.

This area of widespread tree damage was inaccessible and not viewable to the NWS damage survey team that visited the valley nearby immediately following the event.
Post-event interrogation of radar imagery from the event shows a strong rotation couplet above this damage area. After consulting with other Great Plains NWS staff with more than 20 years of tornado-damage-determining experience, this was determined to be tornado damage. The tree fall pattern and path were consistent with strong tornadic rotation.
The EF2 designation comes from looking at the softwood damage indicator of the Enhanced Fujita Scale. Pictures show thousands of pine trees snapped at various heights, with hardly any trees remaining upright. There was some evidence of debarking in photos as well. For this reason, wind speeds were estimated to be between 128 and 131 mph, based on the upper bound for softwood trunks snapped and the expected damage for softwood debarked.

Based on analysis of the storm survey findings and OKX dual pol radar reflectivity, velocity and derived data (including a tornadic debris signature), it was determined that an EF0 tornado first touched down at Juniper Hill farms around 1117 pm, damaging a greenhouse and downing a couple of large trees on the property.
The tornadic circulation likely lifted or skipped along as it tracked east northeast across a one mile stretch of remote wooded area, before touching down and shearing several tree tops and large limbs in the vicinity of Cottage Way, Walnut Place, and Lipco Road, between Sound Avenue and Old Sound Avenue. Peripheral straight line wind damage to a large tree was noted near Shirley Road and Horton Avenue to the north of Sound Avenue as well.
The tornadic circulation likely skipped east northeast in the vicinity of Old Sound Avenue/Main Street over Love Lane and Wickham Avenue with spotty tree damage noted, before definitively touching down once again between Wickham Ave and Mary's Road to the north of Pike Street, with a large maple tree sheared a few feet from its base, minor siding and roof damage, and leaf splatter on the west and south sides of homes. This most prominent damage path, about 50 to 75 yards in width, continued across Mary's Road, where 3 evergreen trees were snapped at their base in a convergent pattern (the 2 southernmost trees laying in a northeast direction and the northernmost tree laying in a southeast direction). The tornado continued eastward across the Mattituck-Cutchogue Jr/Sr high school track, twisting and damaging a large scoreboard, overturning metals benches, and laying down a 100 ft section of wind fence on the north side of the adjacent tennis courts in a northerly direction (again consistent with a convergent wind pattern). The tornado then continued east over the high school, ripping up large sections of asphalt roofing material over one of the main buildings. The damage across the high school grounds was the most severe along the path, consistent with tornadic winds of 75 to 85 mph.
The tornado then exited east over an area of homes on Village Lane, causing significant tree and fence damage to several homes, before likely lifting around 1120 pm as the rotating storm continued eastward over the farm fields and vineyards that lay to the east.

An aerial survey confirmed that the tornado damage was to tin metal roof panels that were peeled off of a plant on CR-1200. As the tornado continued northeast, near FM-411, a single family home had all of its walls removed with only the interior room left standing where a family of three sheltered where winds were estimated at 150 mph. After it crossed FM-411, it hit another single family home and collapsed all the walls, injuring a woman who left her vehicle to take shelter inside the home. The tornado continued on to CR-1275 where debarking of a few trees was first observed in addition to thousands of trees that were snapped and uprooted throughout the path of the tornado. It then crossed US-82, CR-2123, CR-2124, and FM-2283. At FM-2283, it destroyed a single family home along with several outbuildings. This area could not be surveyed at this location as debris removal had already begun. The tornado then continued to move along CR-2125 and CR-2030 before taking a more eastward jog across SH-37. At this point, it is estimated that it was about a third of a mile wide and it began to widen further as it demonstrated more widespread tree snaps and isolated debarking throughout the remainder of Red River County. After crossing SH-37, the tornado wiped a single family home off of its foundation north of Clarksville with large portions of the walls and roof carried several hundred yards northeast of the home. This damage was surrounded by widespread tree snaps with isolated debarking. This location was reviewed by a regional Quick Response Team (QRT) that determined the damage at this location was EF-4 with maximum winds of 170 mph. This was based on the construction of the home, the debris field spread 50-200 yards downstream from the home in small pieces, and the slab of the home being wiped clean. Ten people on the property of the home took shelter in an oil drain of a metal outbuilding that was completely destroyed with no injuries. The damage swath widened to approximately 0.6 miles northeast of Clarksville as it approached Acworth and continued to cross the Red River. Before it crossed the Red River, it collapsed all the walls on a single family home and completely destroyed Mount Olive Church. It then lifted a double-wide manufactured home off the ground near FM-1159 and threw it 50 yards with three dogs inside that all survived. The tornado then crossed the Red River into south-central McCurtain County, Oklahoma. This is the continuation of the Red River County Texas EF-4 tornado. This tornado had weakened upon entering Southern McCurtain County Oklahoma, producing EF-2 damage in rural areas southwest of Idabel, ripping the roofs off of several single family homes. Shortly before entering Idabel, the outer edge of this tornado hit the Oklahoma Mesonet observing platform located about 5 miles to the southwest off of Ravens Nest Road. An anemometer located 10 meters above the platform measured a wind gust of 108 mph, with a nearby single family home sustaining roof damage where EF-2 winds estimated near 125 mph removed a large section of the roof structure with a wall collapsing on another single family home off of Osprey Road. The tornado continued on to snap several hundred trees before hitting a single family home off of Boss Road which had a wall collapse and partial roof damage that could not be rated due to trees falling into the home. More EF-2 damage was observed as the tornado approached Highway 259 when the tornado removed the roof and much of the second story off of a single family home. The two people in the home took shelter on the first floor under the stairs, preventing injury as winds estimated at 125 mph damaged the home. As the tornado moved northeast across Stone Haven Road, a Davis weather station recorded a gust of approximately 130 mph.
Upon entering Idabel, the tornado damaged additional roofs of homes in several neighborhoods on the southeast side of town. One of the most hard hit subdivisions was Country Club Estates. None of the homes in the Country Club Estates were rated due to tree damage which resulted in much of the structural damage from trees falling into homes. Nearby at the Idabel Country Club, nearly every tree sustained damage on approximately six holes, with mostly snaps observed. There was also some debarking of trees in this area, where an EF-3 swath of damage had begun. Behind the golf course, a single family home was destroyed with most of its walls collapsed except for a small interior room.
The tornado continued to move northeast, hitting the Kiamichi Family Medical Center where EF-2 damage (near 115 mph) was estimated due to the facade components that were torn from the structure. As the tornado approached Highway 259 and East Washington Street, it damaged the sign of a McDonald's and a swath of EF-3 winds completely destroyed the Donut Crossing and Express Tire stores. A sign from the Donut Crossing store was lofted by the tornado and carried 14.3 miles where it was found on the west side of Eagletown. After crossing East Washington Street, the tornado completely destroyed the Trinity Baptist Church. Winds at this location were estimated to be near 155 mph with the total destruction of the metal building system which was surrounded by a brick wall that collapsed with concrete anchors pulled up from the ground. The tornado moved on to produce narrow EF-2 damage in the more broader EF-1 damage swath with small vorticies likely extending down to the ground from the elevated large funnel cloud at this point.
After moving northeast of Idabel, the tornado crossed mainly rural areas and completely destroyed chicken houses while snapping hardwood and softwood trees for approximately the next ten miles. An areal survey indicates that the tornado briefly lifted near the Little River and then touched down again in a forested area before damaging a metal structure atop a chicken plant off of Craig Road. A survey team from the National Weather Service Little Rock office found EF-2 damage with 135 mph winds between Eagletown and Broken Bow just south of Highway 70, where numerous trees and several wooden utility poles were snapped near the base near the Tyson Craig Feed Mill, a large elevator structure on top of a silo collapsed with a portion of a metal roof and walls ripped off of an adjacent metal building, and a doublewide manufactured home at the eastern end of Box Turtle Road was thrown off of its concrete pad, nearly pulling out an underground shelter, rolling over it, and landing about 30 feet to the north. Over half of the house was stripped of the undercarriage. Only about one-third of the walls/roof were left with the remainder of the structure removed and scattered well to the north.
As the tornado crossed Highway 70 just west of Eagletown, many additional pines and hardwoods were snapped and uprooted. Nearly all utility poles within the path were also snapped or pushed over. The tornado then moved into a heavily forested area north of Eagletown with more specific damage noted from Old Winship Road to Pero Creek through the use of high-resolution satellite imagery before the tornado finally lifted a few miles before reaching the border with Northwestern Sevier County in Southwest Arkansas.
Remarkedly, only 6 injuries and no fatalities were reported from this long track tornado throughout Southern and Eastern McCurtain County Oklahoma. In total, 220 homes were estimated to had been affected by this tornado, with 10-20 businesses damaged or destroyed.

This EF-3 tornado with estimated maximum winds of 155 mph initially started along FM-144 south of the Cason community and very quickly became quite destructive, producing EF-3 damage to a home, and EF-2 damage to multiple structures before tracking northeast to Texas Highway 11. A few mobile homes were destroyed near the start of the tornado which resulted in several injuries. The tornado continued to track northeast from Texas Highway 11 to Highway 49, doing mostly EF-1 damage for 3 miles before reaching Highway 49. As the tornado crossed Highway 49, two nearby homes were completely destroyed and largely swept from their foundations and at least one injury resulted. This damage was only rated EF-2 because of the pier and beam foundation construction of both homes did not anchor the structures well to the intense wind loading. Behind the homes, some isolated tree debarking was observed with a swath of EF-3 damage with maximum winds of 140 mph. The tornado continued to the northeast, completely destroying a mobile home along CR-3201, where one fatality associated with this tornado occurred.

This tornado was determined to be the strongest one produced by this particular thunderstorm and generated a few spots of low end EF-3 damage in several locations along its nearly 16-mile long path, with estimated maximum winds near 140 mph. This tornado first touched down along U.S. Highway 67 to the southwest of Simms and quickly grew in strength and width after tracking a few miles, briefing reaching a width of nearly a half mile at times. Just west of Simms and continuing northeast just past FM-561, the tornado produced many instances of EF-2 damage to both trees and structures. As the tornado crossed FM-561, there were several structures, a few well built, which had roofs and many walls removed, with 140 mph winds estimated here which were just inside the EF-3 threshold. Additionally, near this structural damage, there was a small section of asphalt road removed from FM-561 and the road debris was thrown into one residence.

In the vicinity of Cook St and Theard St, several homes were severely damaged, with portions of roof structure removed, and one home was completely shifted from its foundation. After crossing the Westbank Expressway and moving into Algiers, the tornado again caused significant structural damage along Tita St. One home was shifted from its foundation and began to roll over, being completely destroyed in the process. Three others suffered significant roof structure loss or partial wall collapse. A church was also shifted from its foundation and destroyed on Wiltz Ln. The tornado then crossed the river and moved into Arabi. It continued to cause damage to trees, power lines and structures as it moved northeastward. Minor fascia damage was noted to an apartment building where the tornado crossed Patricia street and moved into an inaccessible forested area. The track was extended into the the Florida Walk Canal based on high resolution satellite data indicating tree damage along the path through the forest. It may have continued into the marsh, but no damage was observable. The maximum rating of 125 mph EF-2 is based on the homes that lost all or most of their roof structure as well as suffering some wall collapse.",2,125,NWS Storm Survey,LA,,,622064,"1071399, 1071404, 1071405",Tornado,Supercell

The first major change was to the intensity of the tornado. Complete deforestation of trees to the southwest of County Road 31 was noted on satellite imagery, indicating numerous if not all trees in the path were uprooted/snapped low at their base. Based on this, the intensity is bumped to 130mph making this a high-end EF2. The next major change is to end the tornado just northeast of County Road 31. Sentinel satellite imagery indicates the tornado occluded to the left rather abruptly, and reached its widest point of 140 yards as it once again produced EF2 damage with widespread deforestation during the occlusion process. The damage path ends abruptly once the tornado was moving due north on satellite imagery. It's possible it continued to travel to the north for a bit while weakening, however, based on the storm survey on Blue Dirt Road it never reached the road. This satellite imagery explains the discontinuity that was noted in the original storm survey downstream by Blue Dirt Road where a new tornado began.",2,130,NWS Storm Survey,AL,,,622066,"1072169, 1072167",Tornado,Supercell

The original|tornado occluded a few minutes prior to the genesis of this tornado. A remarkable gradient at the point of genesis was noted by the survey team in a field of snapped/uprooted trees, where trees went from untouched to numerous snaps of softwood trees in as little as 5 to 10 feet. Based on sentinel satellite imagery, the tornado maintained intensity, perhaps slightly strengthening as it moved off to the northeast of Blue Dirt Road where significant deforestation was noted in an approximate 120 yard swath. At the tornadoes halfway point, it likely weakened to an EF0/EF1 as it passed by a field with no notable tree damage on satellite imagery. Once the tornado reached Highway 84, it was a very weak EF0 that uprooted a couple softwood trees, lifting at that location.",2,115,NWS Storm Survey,AL,,,622067,"1072168",Tornado,Supercell

It continued northeast across Pass Road and then through the intersection of Belvedere Drive and Belvedere Circle where tree limbs fell on power lines. The roof of a metal shed was ripped off.  The tornado continued across Hiller Park where several pine trees were partially uprooted and unsecured bleachers were thrown 50 yards to the northeast through a chain link fence and on a tennis court. A few roof shingles were missing at nearby military housing. The tornado crossed near Atkinson Rd and Veterans Ave where several oak trees had large limbs snapped.
