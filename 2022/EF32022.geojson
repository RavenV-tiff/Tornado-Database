The location of the track line is a first guess and should be considered unfinished until additional information is obtained. A long track tornado tracked from far southwestern Jack County, through the west side of Jacksboro, and into far southwestern Montague County. The tornado is believed to have begun near Halsell Ranch Rd and Barton Chapel Road where tree damage was observed. The first significant damage noted was on Kinder Mountain Road where the blades of 4 wind turbines were shredded, significant tree damage was observed, and damage to a home and storage barns were observed. The winds were likely EF-2 strength in this location. The tornado continued to be tracked to the northeast by observing mostly minor house/roof damage and notable tree damage. As the tornado approached Jacksboro from the southwest it appeared to strengthen and start to widen. EF-2 damage was observed to a secured manufactured home on O Neal Lane, and also through the Synterra Estates neighborhood, just south of Highway 380 and west of FM 4. From here, the tornado moved into the western portions of Jacksboro where many homes sustained EF-2 damage from Burwick Road all the way to the High School north of Highway 380. The tornado was approximately half a mile wide as it moved through this part of the city. Considerable roof damage and tree damage was observed in this area. Some walls on homes were impacted, and some structures that were not well secured collapsed. The tornado reached EF-3 strength as it approached Wichita Avenue and the Jacksboro Elementary School. One well built home on Wichita Avenue suffered very significant roof damage along with other noted damage that indicated winds over 135 mph. From there, the tornado directly struck the Elementary School where it ripped the roof off the gymnasium, causing one wall to collapse, bent flag poles to the ground, overturned cars, and more. Continuing to the northeast, the tornado moved through the high school campus, also ripping part of the roof off the high school, damaging the press box at the stadium, bending the field goal posts, bending a light pole to the ground, and more. This damage was determined to be EF-2 in strength. Continuing on, the tornado was tracked all the way into far southwestern Montague County by mostly tree damage, damage to metal sheds and outhouses, minor to moderate damage to roofs, and collapsed high tension wire towers.", "F_scale": 3, "Wind": 135, "Source": null, "State_1": "TX", "State_2": null, "State_3": null }, "geometry": { "type": "LineString", "coordinates": [ [ -98.329755085, 33.044649227 ], [ -98.306040882, 33.066198898 ], [ -98.271451114, 33.10884282 ], [ -98.241925357, 33.14966954 ], [ -98.212056278, 33.183868855 ], [ -98.19119942, 33.205631637 ], [ -98.179707338, 33.22316732 ], [ -98.173913767, 33.231406102 ], [ -98.168196796, 33.239163021 ], [ -98.155493854, 33.260768513 ], [ -98.093419525, 33.338301424 ], [ -98.068528625, 33.36224807 ], [ -98.001596121, 33.417963823 ], [ -97.978593496, 33.431574498 ], [ -97.972585348, 33.436373543 ], [ -97.969924596, 33.439453388 ] ] } },

The tornado snapped and uprooted hardwood and softwood trees as it tracked northeast across West Zion Road. It then intensified and caused a swath of EF-2 tree damage that extended from Zion Road near Chisolm Cemetary Road to Chisolm Harbrook Road and Highway 495 South and continuing to the north of Damascus. A large number of trees sustained considerable damage along this swath with several stands of mature trees completely leveled. A home was shifted off of its foundation and a mobile home was destroyed from a fallen tree near the intersection of Chisolm Cemetary Road and Zion Road. The tornado began to intensify as it neared Curtis Fulton Road. Here, the tornado destroyed an anchored shed with metal framing. The most intense damage was located along Smith-Galloway Road. Here, the tornado destroyed a four month old manufactured home. All of the anchoring straps of the home were either snapped or pulled out of the ground, including the anchors themselves. Indications are that the home was likely thrown approximately 100 yards into a stand of trees behind the home. The tornado continued to cause significant tree damage as it crossed a field. The tornado reached its peak intensity of EF3, with 145mph winds, as it destroyed a family home. In addition a horse trailer was also tossed from across the street and significant numbers of hardwood and softwood trees were snapped, including another stand of mature pines that was flattened. The tornado continued to the northeast and weakened by the time it reached Vick Jackson Road. Here, it uprooted several pine trees. The tornado lifted before it reached Old Jackson Road to the southwest of Moscow.", "F_scale": 3, "Wind": 145, "Source": null, "State_1": "MS", "State_2": null, "State_3": null }, "geometry": { "type": "LineString", "coordinates": [ [ -88.897648302, 32.601639884 ], [ -88.875718561, 32.625281135 ], [ -88.863788096, 32.641544425 ], [ -88.841300455, 32.668137567 ], [ -88.827739207, 32.683237215 ], [ -88.810830561, 32.697828707 ], [ -88.802504984, 32.708156886 ] ] } },

It moved northeast through Jefferson Parish and into Orleans Parish. As it moved northeast through the westbank, it caused minor tree damage as well as structural damage. This damage consisted of minor roof, siding and fence damage. There was video footage of the tornado crossing the Mississippi River and damage was found on the eastbank as it moved into St. Bernard Parish, into the town of Arabi. The most intense damage was from the riverbank to the canal in Arabi. It was a very narrow, intense tornado with two areas of concentrated EF3 damage. One was a house that was swept off its raised foundation with all walls and the roof destroyed. This was near where the one fatality occurred. Due to poor construction, this was EF3. The highest EF3 rating was given to a house that was constructed in the last 6 months. While this house was raised on cinder blocks, every tower of blocks had strapping to the house. The house had additional strapping directly into the foundation, as well as strapping from the cinder blocks to the foundation. The house itself held together but was shifted about 50 yards to the north and rotated about 90 degrees. The house next door was also swept off the foundation, moved and mostly destroyed. This also had some evidence of strapping to the slab foundation. This area is what will justify the 160 MPH EF3 rating. Most if not all houses on a north to south path within a 4 block range received minor to substantial roof damage with many houses seeing walls collapsed, leaving interior rooms intact. The tornado then damaged electrical towers on the bank of the canal before moving northeast across the canal. Damage was noted on the other side of the Intracoastal Waterway in New Orleans East and continued northeast. This damage was minor tree damage and minor roof and siding damage. It is estimated the tornado lifted before Joe W Brown Memorial park. There were also at least two injuries noted from the survey but additional injuries will need to be reported from the local officials. Satellite data has still not yet been received and drone video has not been fully analyzed. Length, width and timing information may be updated in the coming days. This data is all preliminary until it is finalized in the official NWS Storm Data record.
