The location of the track line is a first guess and should be considered unfinished until additional information is obtained. A long track tornado tracked from far southwestern Jack County, through the west side of Jacksboro, and into far southwestern Montague County. The tornado is believed to have begun near Halsell Ranch Rd and Barton Chapel Road where tree damage was observed. The first significant damage noted was on Kinder Mountain Road where the blades of 4 wind turbines were shredded, significant tree damage was observed, and damage to a home and storage barns were observed. The winds were likely EF-2 strength in this location. The tornado continued to be tracked to the northeast by observing mostly minor house/roof damage and notable tree damage. As the tornado approached Jacksboro from the southwest it appeared to strengthen and start to widen. EF-2 damage was observed to a secured manufactured home on O Neal Lane, and also through the Synterra Estates neighborhood, just south of Highway 380 and west of FM 4. From here, the tornado moved into the western portions of Jacksboro where many homes sustained EF-2 damage from Burwick Road all the way to the High School north of Highway 380. The tornado was approximately half a mile wide as it moved through this part of the city. Considerable roof damage and tree damage was observed in this area. Some walls on homes were impacted, and some structures that were not well secured collapsed. The tornado reached EF-3 strength as it approached Wichita Avenue and the Jacksboro Elementary School. One well built home on Wichita Avenue suffered very significant roof damage along with other noted damage that indicated winds over 135 mph. From there, the tornado directly struck the Elementary School where it ripped the roof off the gymnasium, causing one wall to collapse, bent flag poles to the ground, overturned cars, and more. Continuing to the northeast, the tornado moved through the high school campus, also ripping part of the roof off the high school, damaging the press box at the stadium, bending the field goal posts, bending a light pole to the ground, and more. This damage was determined to be EF-2 in strength. Continuing on, the tornado was tracked all the way into far southwestern Montague County by mostly tree damage, damage to metal sheds and outhouses, minor to moderate damage to roofs, and collapsed high tension wire towers.", "F_scale": 3, "Wind": 135, "Source": null, "State_1": "TX", "State_2": null, "State_3": null }, "geometry": { "type": "LineString", "coordinates": [ [ -98.329755085, 33.044649227 ], [ -98.306040882, 33.066198898 ], [ -98.271451114, 33.10884282 ], [ -98.241925357, 33.14966954 ], [ -98.212056278, 33.183868855 ], [ -98.19119942, 33.205631637 ], [ -98.179707338, 33.22316732 ], [ -98.173913767, 33.231406102 ], [ -98.168196796, 33.239163021 ], [ -98.155493854, 33.260768513 ], [ -98.093419525, 33.338301424 ], [ -98.068528625, 33.36224807 ], [ -98.001596121, 33.417963823 ], [ -97.978593496, 33.431574498 ], [ -97.972585348, 33.436373543 ], [ -97.969924596, 33.439453388 ] ] } },

The tornado snapped and uprooted hardwood and softwood trees as it tracked northeast across West Zion Road. It then intensified and caused a swath of EF-2 tree damage that extended from Zion Road near Chisolm Cemetary Road to Chisolm Harbrook Road and Highway 495 South and continuing to the north of Damascus. A large number of trees sustained considerable damage along this swath with several stands of mature trees completely leveled. A home was shifted off of its foundation and a mobile home was destroyed from a fallen tree near the intersection of Chisolm Cemetary Road and Zion Road. The tornado began to intensify as it neared Curtis Fulton Road. Here, the tornado destroyed an anchored shed with metal framing. The most intense damage was located along Smith-Galloway Road. Here, the tornado destroyed a four month old manufactured home. All of the anchoring straps of the home were either snapped or pulled out of the ground, including the anchors themselves. Indications are that the home was likely thrown approximately 100 yards into a stand of trees behind the home. The tornado continued to cause significant tree damage as it crossed a field. The tornado reached its peak intensity of EF3, with 145mph winds, as it destroyed a family home. In addition a horse trailer was also tossed from across the street and significant numbers of hardwood and softwood trees were snapped, including another stand of mature pines that was flattened. The tornado continued to the northeast and weakened by the time it reached Vick Jackson Road. Here, it uprooted several pine trees.

It moved northeast through Jefferson Parish and into Orleans Parish. As it moved northeast through the westbank, it caused minor tree damage as well as structural damage. This damage consisted of minor roof, siding and fence damage. There was video footage of the tornado crossing the Mississippi River and damage was found on the eastbank as it moved into St. Bernard Parish, into the town of Arabi. The most intense damage was from the riverbank to the canal in Arabi. It was a very narrow, intense tornado with two areas of concentrated EF3 damage. One was a house that was swept off its raised foundation with all walls and the roof destroyed. This was near where the one fatality occurred. Due to poor construction, this was EF3. The highest EF3 rating was given to a house that was constructed in the last 6 months. While this house was raised on cinder blocks, every tower of blocks had strapping to the house. The house had additional strapping directly into the foundation, as well as strapping from the cinder blocks to the foundation. The house itself held together but was shifted about 50 yards to the north and rotated about 90 degrees. The house next door was also swept off the foundation, moved and mostly destroyed. This also had some evidence of strapping to the slab foundation. This area is what will justify the 160 MPH EF3 rating. Most if not all houses on a north to south path within a 4 block range received minor to substantial roof damage with many houses seeing walls collapsed, leaving interior rooms intact. The tornado then damaged electrical towers on the bank of the canal before moving northeast across the canal. Damage was noted on the other side of the Intracoastal Waterway in New Orleans East and continued northeast. This damage was minor tree damage and minor roof and siding damage. It is estimated the tornado lifted before Joe W Brown Memorial park. There were also at least two injuries noted from the survey but additional injuries will need to be reported from the local officials. Satellite data has still not yet been received and drone video has not been fully analyzed. Length, width and timing information may be updated in the coming days.

The tornado began near the intersection of SR 183 and SR 219 near Adler. Tree damage was observed, of which became quite significant along Barnette Road and Whitetail Road where a wide swath of large pine trees were snapped. Several camper units belonging to a hunting club were also rolled or destroyed with debris blown downwind. The tornado then continued northeastward, causing additional timber damage consisting of uprooted and snapped trees. A few residences had damage either caused directly by wind or fallen trees. A secondary area of significant and widespread tree damage was observed just south of Highway 82 near Trio. Trees were uprooted and snapped over a distance of one-half mile in width. The tornado then continued to the northeast, causing additional timber damage. A few homes were damaged in Wilton in the area of Church Street due to fallen trees. The tornado dissipated over the University of Montevallo campus where a few trees were blown over and some roofing damage was seen on a few buildings. An aerial survey was conducted across portions of Shelby, Bibb, and Perry Counties. Significant timber damage was observed and photographed, mainly in southeast Bibb and northeast Perry Counties. This area is in the Oakmulgee Ranger District of the Talladega National Forest. Though it's hard to assess how many trees were blown down, it's clear that tens of thoudsands of hardwood and softwood trees were snapped and uprooted, with some embedded trunks left debarked in some spots.

The tornado began near Roland Rd and Ovid Ln in Washington County where it snapped tree trunks as it moved northeastward. The tornado crossed Orange Hill Rd and continued on to Gilberts Mill Rd. On Gilberts Mill Rd near Stewart Rd, a barn was destroyed and a manufactured home was damaged and shifted on its foundation, which is in line with EF-1 damage. Snapped and uprooted trees were observed all along Gilberts Mill Rd. Further northeast, a manufactured home sustained significant damage and several outbuildings were destroyed. A camper and a greenhouse were also destroyed here, consistent with EF-1 damage. The tornado strengthened as it continued northeastward along Gilberts Mill Rd before completely destroying and sweeping away an anchored double wide manufactured home and a newer, anchored single wide home. The double wide home was the site of the two fatalities, and one person in the single wide was injured when he was thrown into the tree line grasping his mattress. Several projectiles were driven into the ground at this location. A large boat was also thrown from its trailer and overturned. Damage at this location was consistent with strong EF-2 winds. The tornado continued to strengthen as it moved across Jewell Rd and at that location, a well-built brick home was partially destroyed and likely was sideswiped by the tornado. The end of the home that was hit sustained major collapse of roof and exterior brick walls as well as a generator ripped from its anchoring and thrown across a field. The other end of the home was less severely damaged but still suffered major roof loss. A car in the driveway was pushed off of the driveway, and an attached carport was destroyed. Across the street, a wood frame home with block foundation was completely destroyed and swept from the foundation, leaving only some cinder blocks and a floor joist. The debris from the house was thrown into a pole barn which was also destroyed. An injury occurred at this site when the home occupant ran to the barn and dove under his pickup truck. The damage to this home and the brick home are consistent with EF-3 damage and maximum winds of 150 mph. The tornado weakened some as it moved northeast, inflicting roof damage to a home and damage to out buildings along Archie Sapp Rd. On Syfrett Rd, several sheds and outbuildings were destroyed, a single wide manufactured home was flipped onto its side, and a brick home sustained major roof damage.

The tornado had a path length of nearly 36 miles with a \nmaximum path width of 500 yards. The peak wind associated with the \ntornado was 160 mph.\n\nThe tornado touched down near Ulmer, SC around 603 pm as an EF2 and \nsnapped trees and telephone poles. The initial touchdown point was \nalong Wells Branch Road near the Barnwell County line in Allendale \nCounty and crossed into Bamberg county near the intersection of Highway \n321 and Highway 301. After this point, the tornado rapidly intensified \nand moved through a large forest of mostly softwood pine, with hardwood\noaks in the forest for some stretch. As it approached Popeye Rd in \nBamberg County, the tornado strengthened into a strong EF3 with winds \nestimated at 160 mph. Remarkable damage was done to both softwoods and \nhardwoods in this forest, with an estimated 2 miles of 80-100% forest \nblowdown. In a particularly intense section, the tornado scoured the \nground and stripped pine needles off of young pine trees. Additionally,\nmany younger pine trees in this area were debarked and delimbed. On \neither side of this were sections of pine and oak that had been snapped\nlow, at or below 5 feet, to the ground. Strong EF3 damage is estimated \nto have continued from Popeye Road across Kirkland Creek and then \ntowards Wild Flower Road in Bamberg County. From here, the tornado \nweakened a bit  as it approached Alligator road. The tornado was near \nits peak width at this time, then striking a more residential area along\nCarver road. Here, one mobile home was completely destroyed, with a home\nhaving its roof completely gone and some partial wall collapses. On \neither side of the center of the track, other homes sustained different \ndegrees of damage to their roofs and siding. The tornado continued \nnortheastward and maintained some EF2 strength as it did so, primarily \nto trees. Much of the damage on Macedonia Church Rd was from trees \nfalling on homes. The tornado showed signs of weakening by this point \nas it approached Orangeburg county, and it is distinctly possible that \nthere were multiple weak vortexes impacting only  the tops of trees. EF0\nand weak EF1 damage was noted until the county line with Orangeburg, \nwhere the tornado regained some of its strength and continued doing \ndamage. The tornado approached the North Fork of the Edisto river and\nimpacted a couple of homes, doing some significant tree damage on both\nproperties. As the tornado approached Freedom Road in Orangeburg County,\nit produced EF0 and EF1 damage continuing to snap trees. The tornado \ncontinued to weaken gradually as it approached the city of Bowman, \nfinally dissipating about 2 miles north of the city around 6:53 PM.

Video evidence taken on the ground during the tornadic event, and areal footage of the damage track show the parent circulation produced at least 3 small, brief tornadoes while the storm circulation was near and east of the county line. Scattered damage points and small paths are making it difficult to determine which areas may have been impacted by each of these smaller tornadoes before the parent tornado formed. Therefore, in the area just east of the Williamson/Bell County line, the damage extent of the tornadic track has been widened to include all the known damage points (all EF-0s or EF-1s). In this case, since it is too difficult to discern the smaller tracks, and because they all formed from the same parent circulation within a short amount of time of each other, they will all be considered one tornado. The maximum width listed will remain the maximum width of the parent tornado (the EF-3 tornado). The tornado which began in northern Williamson County entered extreme southern Bell county north of the junction between Bell County Road 231 and FM 2843. In this area there was a narrow swath of tree damage consistent with EF-0 intensity wind speeds, with some damage to outbuildings as well. The tornado moved east northeast and intersected FM 2843, where the damage to trees and structures became much more significant. At least 15-20 damaged homes were visible to the survey team on both sides of FM 2843, with the most significant damage concentrated near the junction of FM 2843 and Buttermilk Road. In this vicinity, at least 10 structures suffered EF-2 to EF-3 intensity damage, with a small cluster of homes experiencing estimated peak tornado wind speeds of 150 to 165 mph. These structures had all or most of their roofs removed, and some of them had one or more exterior walls collapsed. Two churches along FM 2843 in the vicinity of Buttermilk Road were seriously damaged, with roofing material removed and multiple walls collapsed. Numerous vehicles in the area had significant damage consistent with being rolled or having flying projectiles thrown into them. Many hardwood trees along the FM 2843 corridor in the tornado path were uprooted or snapped, and many power poles were also snapped. Beyond Buttermilk Road, the tornado continued traveling east- northeastward another 1.5 miles along FM 2843, then began a sharp turn to the northeast and eventually northerly direction. Aerial footage allowed us to track the damage through inaccessible areas where notable tree damage, damage to homes and barns was observed along the path of the tornado. The tornado reached Crows Ranch Rd and damaged aluminum panels of the roof of a home and blew in the panel garage door. It continued over a ridge line, then intensified shortly before crossing FM 2484. It uprooted many large trees, shifted a large barn's walls, lifted roof panels off a shed, and caused significant damage to a residence. The residence's roof was almost entirely removed from the structure, and a section of the south facing wall was blown in. The east facing wall was completely blown out, all consistent with a high-end EF2 rating in this location. The tornado then continued northwest into the South Shore neighborhood, and then into Union Grove Park where it lifted shortly after moving onto Stillhouse Hollow Lake.", "F_scale": 3, "Wind": 165, "Source": null, "State_1": "TX", "State_2": null, "State_3": null }, "geometry": { "type": "LineString", "coordinates": [ [ -97.788012111, 30.884611356 ], [ -97.783720577, 30.885421614 ], [ -97.777927006, 30.886231865 ], [ -97.774880016, 30.886452842 ], [ -97.769463359, 30.887741861 ], [ -97.759721576, 30.89179295 ], [ -97.751267254, 30.893339685 ], [ -97.745302021, 30.892897763 ], [ -97.737382734, 30.892308531 ], [ -97.732565487, 30.891682468 ], [ -97.730229412, 30.891795427 ], [ -97.701279964, 30.897948632 ], [ -97.693881426, 30.900121278 ], [ -97.687808905, 30.902772577 ], [ -97.684204016, 30.904429602 ], [ -97.6795648, 30.905515858 ], [ -97.669522609, 30.908130186 ], [ -97.657523077, 30.912751113 ], [ -97.64427967, 30.917242955 ], [ -97.635447826, 30.919580839 ], [ -97.631220665, 30.921476876 ], [ -97.627830352, 30.923998731 ], [ -97.625620212, 30.926078751 ], [ -97.623603191, 30.928729331 ], [ -97.622186985, 30.932705062 ], [ -97.6222299, 30.936680629 ], [ -97.622659053, 30.950078542 ], [ -97.624134939, 30.963474577 ], [ -97.625489455, 30.983247775 ], [ -97.623928409, 31.016722702 ] ] } }
