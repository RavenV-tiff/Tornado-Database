The tornado moved to the northeast across rural areas of southern into central Lucas county primarily in wooded areas and cropland with little damage. Of note however, was a satellite tornado observed in chasing video (in seperate Storm Data entry) which developed north of the main tornado and moved south toward the main circulation, doing a complete revolution around the main tornado before being absorbed. Shortly afterwards, the tornado crossed State Highway 14 south of Chariton destroying a conservation center which was rated EF3. The tornado continued to the northeast removing a roof from a house along 235th Trail and passed through an open field before entering Red Haw State Park. The tornado ripped through a campground in the park with one fatality and one injury occurring. The tornado exited the park and crossed Highway 34 east of Chariton with numerous outbuildings and power poles damage or destroyed.

The tornado is believed to have begun near Halsell Ranch Rd and Barton Chapel Road where tree damage was observed. The first significant damage noted was on Kinder Mountain Road where the blades of 4 wind turbines were shredded, significant tree damage was observed, and damage to a home and storage barns was observed. The winds were likely EF2 strength in this location. The tornado continued to be tracked to the northeast by observing mostly minor house/roof damage and notable tree damage. As the tornado approached Jacksboro from the southwest it appeared to strengthen and widen. EF2 damage was observed to a secured manufactured home on ONeal Lane and also through the Synterra Estates neighborhood, just south of Highway 380 and west of FM 4. From here, the tornado moved into the western portions of Jacksboro where many homes sustained EF2 damage from Burwick Road all the way to the High School north of Highway 380. The tornado was approximately half a mile wide as it moved through this part of the city. Considerable roof damage and tree damage was observed in this area. Some walls on homes were impacted, and some structures that were not well secured collapsed. The tornado reached EF3 strength as it approached Wichita Avenue and the Jacksboro Elementary School. One well built home on Wichita Avenue suffered very significant roof damage along with other noted damage that indicated winds over 135 mph. From there, the tornado directly struck the elementary school where it ripped the roof off the gymnasium, causing one wall to collapse, bent flag poles to the ground, overturned cars, and more. Continuing to the northeast, the tornado moved through the high school campus, also ripping part of the roof off the high school, damaging the press box at the stadium, bending the field goal posts, bending a light pole to the ground, and more. This damage was determined to be EF2 in strength. Continuing on, the tornado was tracked all the way into far southwestern Montague County by mostly tree damage, damage to metal sheds and outhouses, minor to moderate damage to roofs, and collapsed high tension wire towers. Maximum estimated winds were in the 140-150 mph range. The total length of the tornado was 34.5 miles, accounting for the 0.53 miles the tornado tracked into Montague County (see separate entry). This tornado is a continuation from the EF3 tornado in Jack County. As the tornado crossed the county line into Montague County, it was already entering its dissipation stage.

The tornado snapped and uprooted hardwood and softwood trees as it tracked northeast across West Zion Road. It then intensified and caused a swath of EF-2 tree damage that extended from Zion Road near Chisolm Cemetary Road to Chisolm Harbrook Road and Highway 495 South and continuing to the north of Damascus. A large number of trees sustained considerable damage along this swath with several stands of mature trees completely leveled. A home was shifted off of its foundation and a mobile home was destroyed from a fallen tree near the intersection of Chisolm Cemetary Road and Zion Road. The tornado began to intensify as it neared Curtis Fulton Road. Here, the tornado destroyed an anchored shed with metal framing. The most intense damage was located along Smith-Galloway Road. Here, the tornado destroyed a four month old manufactured home. All of the anchoring straps of the home were either snapped or pulled out of the ground, including the anchors themselves. Indications are that the home was likely thrown approximately 100 yards into a stand of trees behind the home. The tornado continued to cause significant tree damage as it crossed a field. The tornado reached its peak intensity of EF3, with 145mph winds, as it destroyed a family home. In addition a horse trailer was also tossed from across the street and significant numbers of hardwood and softwood trees were snapped, including another stand of mature pines that was flattened. The tornado continued to the northeast and weakened by the time it reached Vick Jackson Road. Here, it uprooted several pine trees.

It moved northeast through Jefferson Parish. As it moved northeast through the Westbank, it caused minor tree damage as well as structural damage. This damage consisted of minor roof, siding and fence damage. The tornado continued into Orleans Parish. A moved into Orleans Parish from Jefferson Parish near Wyoming Street. As it moved northeast through the Westbank, it caused minor tree damage as well as structural damage. This damage consisted of minor roof, siding and fence damage. The tornado continued into St. Bernard Parish. A tornado moved into St. Bernard Parish from Orleans Parish near Friscoville Avenue at the Mississippi River. The most intense damage was from the riverbank to the canal in Arabi. It was a very narrow, intense tornado with two areas of concentrated EF3 damage. One was a house that was swept off its raised foundation with all walls and the roof destroyed. This was near where the one fatality occurred. Due to poor construction, this was EF3. The highest EF3 rating was given to a house that was constructed in the last 6 months. While this house was raised on cinder blocks, every tower of blocks had strapping to the house. The house had additional strapping directly into the foundation, as well as strapping from the cinder blocks to the foundation. The house itself held together but was shifted about 50 yards to the north and rotated about 90 degrees. The house next door was also swept off the foundation, moved and mostly destroyed. This also had some evidence of strapping to the slab foundation. This area is what will justify the 160 MPH EF3 rating. Most if not all houses on the south to north path within a 4 block west to east range received minor to substantial roof damage with many houses seeing walls collapsed, leaving interior rooms intact. The tornado then damaged electrical towers on the bank of the canal before moving northeast across Intercoastal Waterway back into Orleans Parish. A tornado moved into Orleans Parish from St Bernard Parish near the Intercoastal Waterway. Damage was noted on the east side of the Intracoastal Waterway in New Orleans East and continued northeast.

As it moved north-northeast from near the mall, the tornado blew down a cellular phone tower, and destroyed a building near Main Drive. As it continued north-northeast, it damaged numerous homes and businesses, and blew down numerous trees. Major portions of the roofs of several homes were blown off on Pagosa Street, and a vehicle was flipped over in a driveway. The tornado then destroyed the gymnasium at George Elementary School, which was a metal building structure. A home just north of the gym was severely damaged, and a couple nearby large, wooden electrical poles were snapped. A large, metal building structure was destroyed as the tornado neared Highway 412, with several other businesses nearby severely damaged. A hangar was destroyed and other buildings were damaged on the east side of the Springdale Airport. Minor damage to trees and to the roofs of homes continued until the tornado neared Emma Avenue, where it appeared to dissipate.

The tornado touched down near the intersection of county road 183 and 219. Tree damage was observed, of which became quite significant along Barnette Road and Whitetail Road, where a wide swath of large pine trees were snapped. The tornado continued to increase in intensity and reached EF3 strength as it approached the Bibb County line. An aerial survey was conducted and significant timber damage was observed and photographed in northeast Perry County. This area is in the Oakmulgee District of the Talladega National Forest. Though it was hard to assess how many trees were blown down, it was clear that tens of thousands of hardwood and softwood trees were snapped and uprooted along the tornadoes path during max intensity. Some trunks were left at least partially debarked. Due to the widespread nature of the timber damage, including some 300-400 yard wide sections of complete blow-down, the rating of this tornado was upgraded to EF3 with estimated peak winds of 145 mph. The tornado crossed into Bibb Count about one mile west of Beaverdam Creek. National Weather Service meteorologists surveyed damage in eastern Bibb County and determined that it was consistent with an EF3 tornado, with maximum winds near 145 mph. This tornado originated in Perry County and crossed into southern Bibb County about one mile west of Beaverdam Creek. The most widespread tree damage occurred near the Perry/Bibb county line in the Oakmulgee National Forest. The tornado continued northeast and crossed Highway 82 near the northeast corner of the National Forest. Trees were uprooted and snapped in this area. The tornado tracked across northeast Bibb County, causing additional timber damage as it approached the Brierfield community. It crossed into Shelby County near Moreland Road. National Weather Service meteorologists surveyed damage in southwest Shelby County and determined that it was consistent with an EF1 tornado, with maximum winds near 88 mph. This tornado originated in Perry County, crossed through eastern Bibb County, and crossed into Shelby County near Moreland Road. The tornado mostly uprooted softwood trees as it approached the town of Wilton. A few homes were damaged in Wilton, in the area of Church Street due to fallen trees.

The tornado began near Roland Rd and Ovid Ln in Washington County where it snapped tree trunks as it moved northeastward. The tornado crossed Orange Hill Rd and continued on to Gilberts Mill Rd. On Gilberts Mill Rd near Stewart Rd, a barn was destroyed and a manufactured home was damaged and shifted on its foundation, which is in line with EF-1 damage. Snapped and uprooted trees were observed all along Gilberts Mill Rd. Further northeast, a manufactured home sustained significant damage and several outbuildings were destroyed. A camper and a greenhouse were also destroyed here, consistent with EF-1 damage. The tornado strengthened as it continued northeastward along Gilberts Mill Rd before completely destroying and sweeping away an anchored double wide manufactured home and a newer, anchored single wide home. The double wide home was the site of the two fatalities, and one person in the single wide was injured when he was thrown into the tree line grasping his mattress. Several projectiles were driven into the ground at this location. A large boat was also thrown from its trailer and overturned. Damage at this location was consistent with strong EF-2 winds. The tornado continued to strengthen as it moved across Jewel Rd and at that location, a well-built brick home was partially destroyed and likely was sideswiped by the tornado. The end of the home that was hit sustained major collapse of roof and exterior brick walls as well as a generator ripped from its anchoring and thrown across a field. The other end of the home was less severely damaged but still suffered major roof loss. A car in the driveway was pushed off of the driveway, and an attached carport was destroyed. Across the street, a wood frame home with block foundation was completely destroyed and swept from the foundation, leaving only some cinder blocks and a floor joist. The debris from the house was thrown into a pole barn which was also destroyed. An injury occurred at this site when the home occupant ran to the barn and dove under his pickup truck. The damage to this home and the brick home are consistent with EF3 damage and maximum winds of 150 mph. The tornado weakened some as it moved northeast, inflicting roof damage to a home and damage to out buildings along Archie Sapp Rd. On Syfrett Rd, several sheds and outbuildings were destroyed, a single wide manufactured home was flipped onto its side, and a brick home sustained major roof damage.

Near this location, the tornado threw a grain silo and flipped and threw a few farm trailers and vehicles, consistent with an EF-1 tornado rating. The tornado continued northeast across Wells Branch Road, where it widened to approximately 465 yards and downed many trees before crossing into Bamberg County near the intersection of Highway 321 and Highway 301 at 506 PM. A National Weather Service survey team confirmed a EF3 tornado that began in eastern Allendale County and then moved into Bamberg County near the intersection of Hwy 321 and Hwy 301. The tornado then crossed into Orangeburg county just north of Hwy 78. In Bamberg county the tornado moved through a large forest of mostly softwood pine, with hardwood oaks in the forest for some stretch. As it approached Popeye Rd, the tornado strengthened into a strong EF3 with winds estimated at 160 mph. Remarkable damage was done to both softwoods and hardwoods in this forest, with an estimated 2 miles of 80-100% forest blowdown. In a particularly intense section, the tornado scoured the ground and stripped pine needles off of young pine trees. Additionally, many younger pine trees in this area were debarked and delimbed. On either side of this were sections of pine and oak that had been snapped low, at or below 5 feet, to the ground. Strong EF3 damage is estimated to have continued from Popeye Road across Kirkland Creek and then towards Wild Flower Road in Bamberg County. From here, the tornado weakened a bit as it approached Alligator road. The tornado was near its peak width at this time, then striking a more residential area along Carver road. Here, one mobile home was completely destroyed, with a home having its roof completely removed and some partial wall collapses. On either side of the center of the track, other homes sustained different degrees of damage to their roofs and siding. The tornado continued northeastward and maintained EF2 strength, primarily causing damage to trees. Much of the damage on Macedonia Church Rd was from trees falling on homes. The tornado showed signs of weakening by this point as it approached Orangeburg county, and it is distinctly possible that there were multiple weak vortexes impacting only the tops of trees. EF0 and weak EF1 damage was noted until the county line with Orangeburg. A National Weather Service survey team confirmed a tornado that began in eastern Allendale County, moved across Bamberg County, and then crossed into Orangeburg County just north of Hwy 78. At its strongest, the tornado was an EF3 in Bamberg County, but produced EF1 damage in Orangeburg County. In Orangeburg County, the tornado approached the North Fork of the Edisto river and impacted a couple of homes, resulting in significant tree damage on both properties. As the tornado approached Freedom Road in Orangeburg County, it produced EF0 and EF1 damage as it continued to snap trees.

At this area significant tree damage was observed with several large mature oak trees uprooted. The damage in this area was rated EF1. The tornado continued east and crossed CR228 where more tree damage was seen. The tornado turned toward the east-northeast and likely remained on the ground east of CR228 (Doppler radar indicated a tornado debris signature). After approximately 1.3 miles the storm turned back to the east before it neared the Williamson/Bell County line about 0.15 miles west-northwest of CR231 in far northern Williamson County. A mobile home was shifted off its foundation at this location on the county line and multiple large oak trees were snapped and uprooted. This damage was also rated EF1. While in Williamson County this tornado had a maximum width of 500 yards and maximum winds of near 100 mph with a path length of 3.54 miles. This tornado began in northern Williamson County and additional information about the beginning of this tornado track can be found from the NWS Austin/San Antonio office.\nVideo evidence taken on the ground during the tornadic event, and areal footage of the damage track show the parent circulation produced at least 3 small, brief tornadoes while the storm circulation was near and east of the county line. Scattered damage points and small paths are making it difficult to determine which areas may have been impacted by each of these smaller tornadoes before the parent tornado formed. Therefore, in the area just east of the Williamson/Bell County line, the damage extent of the tornadic track has been widened to include all the known damage points (all EF-0s or EF-1s). In this case, since it is too difficult to discern the smaller tracks, and because they all formed from the same parent circulation within a short amount of time of each other, they will all be considered one tornado. The maximum width listed will remain the maximum width of the parent tornado (the EF-3 tornado).\nThe tornado, which began in northern Williamson County, entered extreme southern Bell County north of the junction between Bell County Road 231 and FM 2843. In this area there was a narrow swath of tree damage consistent with EF-0 intensity wind speeds, with some damage to outbuildings as well. The tornado moved east-northeast and intersected FM 2843, where the damage to trees and structures became much more significant. At least 15-20 damaged homes were visible to the survey team on both sides of FM 2843, with the most significant damage concentrated near the junction of FM 2843 and Buttermilk Road. In this vicinity, at least 10 structures suffered EF-2 to EF-3 intensity damage, with a small cluster of homes experiencing estimated peak tornado wind speeds of 150 to 165 mph. These structures had all or most of their roofs removed, and some of them had one or more exterior walls collapsed. Two churches along FM 2843 in the vicinity of Buttermilk Road were seriously damaged, with roofing material removed and multiple walls collapsed. Numerous vehicles in the area had significant damage consistent with being rolled or having flying projectiles thrown into them. Many hardwood trees along the FM 2843 corridor in the tornado path were uprooted or snapped, and many power poles were also snapped.\nBeyond Buttermilk Road, the tornado continued traveling east-northeastward another 1.5 miles along FM 2843, then began a sharp turn to the northeast and eventually a northerly direction. Aerial footage allowed us to track the damage through inaccessible areas where notable tree damage, damage to homes and barns was observed along the path of the tornado.\nThe tornado reached Crows Ranch Rd and damaged aluminum panels of the roof of a home and blew in the panel garage door. It continued over a ridge line, then intensified again shortly before crossing FM 2484. It uprooted many large trees, shifted a large barn's walls, lifted roof panels off a shed, and caused significant damage to a residence. The residence's roof was almost entirely removed from the structure, and a section of the south facing wall was blown in. The east facing wall was completely blown out, all consistent with a high-end EF2 rating in this location. The tornado then continued northwest into the South Shore neighborhood, and then into Union Grove Park where it lifted shortly after moving onto Stillhouse Hollow Lake.", "F_scale": 3, "Wind": 165, "Source": "NWS Storm Survey", "State_1": "TX", "State_2": null, "State_3": null, "SPC_id": 621315, "NCEI_id": "1021318, 1022969", "Tornado_type": "Tornado", "Storm_morphology": "Supercell" }, "geometry": { "type": "LineString", "coordinates": [ [ -97.788012111, 30.884611356 ], [ -97.783720577, 30.885421614 ], [ -97.777927006, 30.886231865 ], [ -97.774880016, 30.886452842 ], [ -97.769463359, 30.887741861 ], [ -97.759721576, 30.89179295 ], [ -97.751267254, 30.893339685 ], [ -97.745302021, 30.892897763 ], [ -97.737382734, 30.892308531 ], [ -97.732565487, 30.891682468 ], [ -97.730229412, 30.891795427 ], [ -97.701279964, 30.897948632 ], [ -97.693881426, 30.900121278 ], [ -97.687808905, 30.902772577 ], [ -97.684204016, 30.904429602 ], [ -97.6795648, 30.905515858 ], [ -97.669522609, 30.908130186 ], [ -97.657523077, 30.912751113 ], [ -97.64427967, 30.917242955 ], [ -97.635447826, 30.919580839 ], [ -97.631220665, 30.921476876 ], [ -97.627830352, 30.923998731 ], [ -97.625620212, 30.926078751 ], [ -97.623603191, 30.928729331 ], [ -97.622186985, 30.932705062 ], [ -97.6222299, 30.936680629 ], [ -97.622659053, 30.950078542 ], [ -97.624134939, 30.963474577 ], [ -97.625489455, 30.983247775 ], [ -97.623928409, 31.016722702 ] ] } },

Along County Road 138, at least seven large steel electrical transmission towers were bent over, with the western most tower blown to the south. Roof damage occurred to another home just north of County Road 138 an another outbuilding was heavily damaged along County Road 83. The tornado then turned to the north and damaged another house, destroyed a barn and broke wooden utility poles along County Road 85 to the south of Lockett.\nThe tornado continued to move north and moved through mainly the eastern portion of the town of Lockett where it produced roof and wall damage to a number of homes and businesses, as well as tree and power pole damage. The tornado continued to veer in direction and moved north-northwest in areas north of Lockett before dissipating.", "F_scale": 3, "Wind": 140, "Source": "NWS Storm Survey", "State_1": "TX", "State_2": null, "State_3": null, "SPC_id": 621470, "NCEI_id": "1033694, 1033695", "Tornado_type": "Tornado", "Storm_morphology": "Supercell" }, "geometry": { "type": "LineString", "coordinates": [ [ -99.61622613, 33.934917693 ], [ -99.575714045, 33.935487381 ], [ -99.532112056, 33.942038529 ], [ -99.495503304, 33.953742459 ], [ -99.47529214, 33.961831323 ], [ -99.458081123, 33.97054296 ], [ -99.429585335, 33.98876348 ], [ -99.405940943, 34.005743485 ], [ -99.39057725, 34.014423592 ], [ -99.382852488, 34.019047877 ], [ -99.376758509, 34.023245087 ], [ -99.371522837, 34.027726624 ], [ -99.367443916, 34.032306078 ], [ -99.362510615, 34.044085781 ], [ -99.360879832, 34.054113096 ], [ -99.360196598, 34.066092654 ], [ -99.360711582, 34.081306999 ], [ -99.362338954, 34.0932154 ], [ -99.366544657, 34.106861407 ], [ -99.370235377, 34.116952351 ], [ -99.377101832, 34.127326292 ] ] } },

As the tornado crossed Highway 49, two nearby homes were completely destroyed and largely swept from their foundations and at least one injury resulted. This damage was only rated EF-2 because of the pier and beam foundation construction of both homes did not anchor the structures well to the intense wind loading. Behind the homes, some isolated tree debarking was observed with a swath of EF-3 damage with maximum winds of 140 mph. The tornado continued to the northeast, completely destroying a mobile home along CR-3201, where one fatality associated with this tornado occurred. The tornado continued to advance northeastward, doing mainly EF-1 damage to trees and some structures before knocking over and destroying a few large electrical transmission lines near the intersection of CR-3211 and CR-3209.

This tornado was determined to be the strongest one produced by this particular thunderstorm and generated a few spots of low end EF-3 damage in several locations along its nearly 16-mile long path, with estimated maximum winds near 140 mph. This tornado first touched down along U.S. Highway 67 to the southwest of Simms and quickly grew in strength and width after tracking a few miles, briefing reaching a width of nearly a half mile at times. Just west of Simms and continuing northeast just past FM-561, the tornado produced many instances of EF-2 damage to both trees and structures. As the tornado crossed FM-561, there were several structures, a few well built, which had roofs and many walls removed, with 140 mph winds estimated here which were just inside the EF-3 threshold. Additionally, near this structural damage, there was a small section of asphalt road removed from FM-561 and the road debris was thrown into one residence. From there, the tornado then tracked northeast nearly four miles through very rural and uninhabited areas west of Texas Highway 98. The tornado finally moved back over Highway 98 and produced another area of considerable damage at the intersection of Highway 98 and CR-1840. In this area, several structures were largely destroyed, including a few small retail buildings, and this again garnered some high end EF-2 and low end EF-3 ratings with no injuries. After this point, the tornado travelled its final seven miles by crossing the southwestern, then western, and then northern portions of the city of New Boston, before ending just west of Highway 8 north of Interstate 30.

This ground scouring is usually a trait associated with very intense tornado vorticies, but it is not an official damage indicator used to rate tornadoes.\nFrom this location, the tornado continued roughly 3.5 miles east-northeast before crossing Wyant Road and the Twelve Mile Post Road intersection. The survey team did not have access in the 3.5 mile span before this intersection, but used available drone footage to confirm significant swaths of tree damage in this gap. Only tree damage was observed along Wyant Road, but the high level of tree snapping was enough to confirm EF-2 strength here. From here, the tornado continued along Wyant Road, which had turned northeast to criss-cross the tornado's path through the hillier terrain. The tornado damage showed a tendency for the tornado to narrow and weaken at times through the terrain, but it did continue without lifting until reaching the Ouachita River. Along the southwestern bank of the river, there were two homes that received significant damage and several outbuildings were totally destroyed with debris thrown into the river. The tornado crossed the river and did significant tree damage along Lee Lane. From there, the tornado continued east-northeast while gradually narrowing and weakening, crossing Highway 559 and Parish Road 6629. Based on a report from the Louisiana Department of Wildlife and Fisheries, additional trees were downed on an unnamed road just east of the intersection of Hotshot Road and Parish Road 6629, with satellite imagery supporting that the tornado finally lifted just east of this road over the Boeuf Wildlife Management Area.", "F_scale": 3, "Wind": 140, "Source": "NWS Storm Survey", "State_1": "LA", "State_2": null, "State_3": null, "SPC_id": 622000, "NCEI_id": "1060628", "Tornado_type": "Tornado", "Storm_morphology": "Supercell" }, "geometry": { "type": "LineString", "coordinates": [ [ -92.065744825, 31.974375428 ], [ -92.03527493, 31.987334495 ], [ -91.998432107, 32.00189306 ], [ -91.992896028, 32.004331394 ], [ -91.982574888, 32.00844366 ], [ -91.973262258, 32.012228239 ], [ -91.958842702, 32.015576004 ], [ -91.950152345, 32.017577327 ], [ -91.94171948, 32.019742346 ] ] } },

It continued on an east northeast track producing damage along Nursery Road. The track continued into Washington County Alabama. The tornado crossed Highway 45 and hit Fruitdale High School where windows were damaged along with roof damage to the school and nearby houses. Widespread tree and power line damage was also observed in the Fruitdale area. The damage in Fruitdale is estimated to have been in the high EF-1 range with winds 105-110 mph. The tornado continued northeast and strengthened as it approached Baxter McIllwain Road. This is where the tornado reached peak intensity. Based on the ground survey, a nearly 500 yard swath of major tree damage was observed with countless hardwood and softwood trees destroyed. The EF-3 peak intensity (140 mph) is based on this swath of major tree damage. The tornado continued to track eastward through Tibbie with more significant to major tree damage (EF-2 intensity), along with roof damage observed along Leo and Boyd Willie Parnell Road.

The tornado then briefly moved back over the lake before crossing Highway 2 where several single family homes were heavily damaged and at least a few shops and outbuildings destroyed. The most heavily damaged structure, warranting a 130 mph wind speed estimate, was a two story home which had its roof and much of the second story removed or destroyed. Two injuries occurred within this home, although both were non-critical. The tornado then tracked over a small portion of the lake again before coming ashore and moving across Corney Creek Drive and Dozier Road. In this area, there were several residences damaged by falling trees, although one cabin was largely destroyed due to a combination of falling trees and wind forcing. The tornado then tracked over a nearly 2 mile span where the survey team had no access, although a tornado debris signature on radar gave confidence that the circulation remained on the ground. The tornado had grown to a width of approximately 500 yards by the time it next crossed Denton Road, where many EF-2 damage indicators were found and four single family homes were heavily damaged or destroyed. One double-wide mobile home here was thrown and completely destroyed, with 5 injuries reported. A single-wide mobile home was also thrown and destroyed, although no injuries were known to the survey team at this location. Two one or two family homes in this location also suffered damage to roofs and some walls. Additionally, extreme tree damage with at least a few trees exhibiting some debarking were found in this area as well. Significant tree damage continued to the northeast as the tornado crossed Highway 15 and moved across Camp Road. The most significant damage associated with this tornado occurred in the Camp Road area as the 400-500 yard wide tornado struck an apartment complex and an adjacent mobile home park. Here, seven of the nine single-wide mobile homes were thrown or completely destroyed. It is estimated that the strongest core of the tornadic winds only clipped the south end of the apartment complex, but one building in this area had a large portion of its roof and some exterior walls removed. This damage warranted the peak 140 mph EF-3 rating of the tornado with widespread mid to strong EF-2 damage occurring throughout this area. According to Louisiana Governor John Bel Edwards, of the 74 units at this housing complex, only 12 of them were habitable following this tornado. The survey team received a confirmation of 14 total injuries, two of which were critical, from this tornado. However, details of which injuries occurred in associated to the various damaged structures along Camp Road were not known. Afterwards, the tornado moved through a nearly 2 mile long heavily forested area inaccessible to the survey team,  although the team did confirm strong EF-2 level tree damage did continue well into this forested area east of Camp Road. The tornado did weaken considerably as it crossed Feazel Road after traversing the wooded area. Here, only EF-1 level structural and tree damage was found. The tornado continued to track another mile or so, producing only EF-0 damage to trees before lifting along Sweet Lily Road.", "F_scale": 3, "Wind": 140, "Source": "NWS Storm Survey", "State_1": "LA", "State_2": null, "State_3": null, "SPC_id": 622049, "NCEI_id": "1061296", "Tornado_type": "Tornado", "Storm_morphology": "QLCS" }, "geometry": { "type": "LineString", "coordinates": [ [ -92.468300644, 32.772000568 ], [ -92.454567734, 32.778495552 ], [ -92.401524368, 32.819330918 ], [ -92.384186569, 32.828418923 ], [ -92.340927902, 32.847745875 ] ] } }
