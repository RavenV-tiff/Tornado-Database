The tornado is believed to have begun near Halsell Ranch Rd and Barton Chapel Road where tree damage was observed. The first significant damage noted was on Kinder Mountain Road where the blades of 4 wind turbines were shredded, significant tree damage was observed, and damage to a home and storage barns was observed. The winds were likely EF2 strength in this location. The tornado continued to be tracked to the northeast by observing mostly minor house/roof damage and notable tree damage. As the tornado approached Jacksboro from the southwest it appeared to strengthen and widen. EF2 damage was observed to a secured manufactured home on ONeal Lane and also through the Synterra Estates neighborhood, just south of Highway 380 and west of FM 4. From here, the tornado moved into the western portions of Jacksboro where many homes sustained EF2 damage from Burwick Road all the way to the High School north of Highway 380. The tornado was approximately half a mile wide as it moved through this part of the city. Considerable roof damage and tree damage was observed in this area. Some walls on homes were impacted, and some structures that were not well secured collapsed. The tornado reached EF3 strength as it approached Wichita Avenue and the Jacksboro Elementary School. One well built home on Wichita Avenue suffered very significant roof damage along with other noted damage that indicated winds over 135 mph. From there, the tornado directly struck the elementary school where it ripped the roof off the gymnasium, causing one wall to collapse, bent flag poles to the ground, overturned cars, and more. Continuing to the northeast, the tornado moved through the high school campus, also ripping part of the roof off the high school, damaging the press box at the stadium, bending the field goal posts, bending a light pole to the ground, and more. This damage was determined to be EF2 in strength. Continuing on, the tornado was tracked all the way into far southwestern Montague County by mostly tree damage, damage to metal sheds and outhouses, minor to moderate damage to roofs, and collapsed high tension wire towers. Maximum estimated winds were in the 140-150 mph range. The total length of the tornado was 34.5 miles, accounting for the 0.53 miles the tornado tracked into Montague County (see separate entry). This tornado is a continuation from the EF3 tornado in Jack County. As the tornado crossed the county line into Montague County, it was already entering its dissipation stage.

The tornado snapped and uprooted hardwood and softwood trees as it tracked northeast across West Zion Road. It then intensified and caused a swath of EF-2 tree damage that extended from Zion Road near Chisolm Cemetary Road to Chisolm Harbrook Road and Highway 495 South and continuing to the north of Damascus. A large number of trees sustained considerable damage along this swath with several stands of mature trees completely leveled. A home was shifted off of its foundation and a mobile home was destroyed from a fallen tree near the intersection of Chisolm Cemetary Road and Zion Road. The tornado began to intensify as it neared Curtis Fulton Road. Here, the tornado destroyed an anchored shed with metal framing. The most intense damage was located along Smith-Galloway Road. Here, the tornado destroyed a four month old manufactured home. All of the anchoring straps of the home were either snapped or pulled out of the ground, including the anchors themselves. Indications are that the home was likely thrown approximately 100 yards into a stand of trees behind the home. The tornado continued to cause significant tree damage as it crossed a field. The tornado reached its peak intensity of EF3, with 145mph winds, as it destroyed a family home. In addition a horse trailer was also tossed from across the street and significant numbers of hardwood and softwood trees were snapped, including another stand of mature pines that was flattened. The tornado continued to the northeast and weakened by the time it reached Vick Jackson Road. Here, it uprooted several pine trees.

It moved northeast through Jefferson Parish. As it moved northeast through the Westbank, it caused minor tree damage as well as structural damage. This damage consisted of minor roof, siding and fence damage. The tornado continued into Orleans Parish. A moved into Orleans Parish from Jefferson Parish near Wyoming Street. As it moved northeast through the Westbank, it caused minor tree damage as well as structural damage. This damage consisted of minor roof, siding and fence damage. The tornado continued into St. Bernard Parish. A tornado moved into St. Bernard Parish from Orleans Parish near Friscoville Avenue at the Mississippi River. The most intense damage was from the riverbank to the canal in Arabi. It was a very narrow, intense tornado with two areas of concentrated EF3 damage. One was a house that was swept off its raised foundation with all walls and the roof destroyed. This was near where the one fatality occurred. Due to poor construction, this was EF3. The highest EF3 rating was given to a house that was constructed in the last 6 months. While this house was raised on cinder blocks, every tower of blocks had strapping to the house. The house had additional strapping directly into the foundation, as well as strapping from the cinder blocks to the foundation. The house itself held together but was shifted about 50 yards to the north and rotated about 90 degrees. The house next door was also swept off the foundation, moved and mostly destroyed. This also had some evidence of strapping to the slab foundation. This area is what will justify the 160 MPH EF3 rating. Most if not all houses on the south to north path within a 4 block west to east range received minor to substantial roof damage with many houses seeing walls collapsed, leaving interior rooms intact. The tornado then damaged electrical towers on the bank of the canal before moving northeast across Intercoastal Waterway back into Orleans Parish. A tornado moved into Orleans Parish from St Bernard Parish near the Intercoastal Waterway. Damage was noted on the east side of the Intracoastal Waterway in New Orleans East and continued northeast.

As it moved north-northeast from near the mall, the tornado blew down a cellular phone tower, and destroyed a building near Main Drive. As it continued north-northeast, it damaged numerous homes and businesses, and blew down numerous trees. Major portions of the roofs of several homes were blown off on Pagosa Street, and a vehicle was flipped over in a driveway. The tornado then destroyed the gymnasium at George Elementary School, which was a metal building structure. A home just north of the gym was severely damaged, and a couple nearby large, wooden electrical poles were snapped. A large, metal building structure was destroyed as the tornado neared Highway 412, with several other businesses nearby severely damaged. A hangar was destroyed and other buildings were damaged on the east side of the Springdale Airport. Minor damage to trees and to the roofs of homes continued until the tornado neared Emma Avenue, where it appeared to dissipate.

The tornado touched down near the intersection of county road 183 and 219. Tree damage was observed, of which became quite significant along Barnette Road and Whitetail Road, where a wide swath of large pine trees were snapped. The tornado continued to increase in intensity and reached EF3 strength as it approached the Bibb County line. An aerial survey was conducted and significant timber damage was observed and photographed in northeast Perry County. This area is in the Oakmulgee District of the Talladega National Forest. Though it was hard to assess how many trees were blown down, it was clear that tens of thousands of hardwood and softwood trees were snapped and uprooted along the tornadoes path during max intensity. Some trunks were left at least partially debarked. Due to the widespread nature of the timber damage, including some 300-400 yard wide sections of complete blow-down, the rating of this tornado was upgraded to EF3 with estimated peak winds of 145 mph. The tornado crossed into Bibb Count about one mile west of Beaverdam Creek. National Weather Service meteorologists surveyed damage in eastern Bibb County and determined that it was consistent with an EF3 tornado, with maximum winds near 145 mph. This tornado originated in Perry County and crossed into southern Bibb County about one mile west of Beaverdam Creek. The most widespread tree damage occurred near the Perry/Bibb county line in the Oakmulgee National Forest. The tornado continued northeast and crossed Highway 82 near the northeast corner of the National Forest. Trees were uprooted and snapped in this area. The tornado tracked across northeast Bibb County, causing additional timber damage as it approached the Brierfield community. It crossed into Shelby County near Moreland Road. National Weather Service meteorologists surveyed damage in southwest Shelby County and determined that it was consistent with an EF1 tornado, with maximum winds near 88 mph. This tornado originated in Perry County, crossed through eastern Bibb County, and crossed into Shelby County near Moreland Road. The tornado mostly uprooted softwood trees as it approached the town of Wilton. A few homes were damaged in Wilton, in the area of Church Street due to fallen trees.

The tornado began near Roland Rd and Ovid Ln in Washington County where it snapped tree trunks as it moved northeastward. The tornado crossed Orange Hill Rd and continued on to Gilberts Mill Rd. On Gilberts Mill Rd near Stewart Rd, a barn was destroyed and a manufactured home was damaged and shifted on its foundation, which is in line with EF-1 damage. Snapped and uprooted trees were observed all along Gilberts Mill Rd. Further northeast, a manufactured home sustained significant damage and several outbuildings were destroyed. A camper and a greenhouse were also destroyed here, consistent with EF-1 damage. The tornado strengthened as it continued northeastward along Gilberts Mill Rd before completely destroying and sweeping away an anchored double wide manufactured home and a newer, anchored single wide home. The double wide home was the site of the two fatalities, and one person in the single wide was injured when he was thrown into the tree line grasping his mattress. Several projectiles were driven into the ground at this location. A large boat was also thrown from its trailer and overturned. Damage at this location was consistent with strong EF-2 winds. The tornado continued to strengthen as it moved across Jewel Rd and at that location, a well-built brick home was partially destroyed and likely was sideswiped by the tornado. The end of the home that was hit sustained major collapse of roof and exterior brick walls as well as a generator ripped from its anchoring and thrown across a field. The other end of the home was less severely damaged but still suffered major roof loss. A car in the driveway was pushed off of the driveway, and an attached carport was destroyed. Across the street, a wood frame home with block foundation was completely destroyed and swept from the foundation, leaving only some cinder blocks and a floor joist. The debris from the house was thrown into a pole barn which was also destroyed. An injury occurred at this site when the home occupant ran to the barn and dove under his pickup truck. The damage to this home and the brick home are consistent with EF3 damage and maximum winds of 150 mph. The tornado weakened some as it moved northeast, inflicting roof damage to a home and damage to out buildings along Archie Sapp Rd. On Syfrett Rd, several sheds and outbuildings were destroyed, a single wide manufactured home was flipped onto its side, and a brick home sustained major roof damage. This damage along Archie Sapp Rd and Syfrett Rd are consistent with EF1 damage.

The tornado had a path length of nearly 35 miles with a maximum path width of 500 yards. The peak wind associated with the tornado was 160 mph. The tornado touched down near Ulmer, SC in Allendale County around 603 pm on a farm just west of Wells Branch Road, where it threw a grain silo and flipped and threw a few farm trailers and vehicles. The tornado continued northeastward across Wells Branch Road, where it downed many trees. The tornado crossed into Bamberg county near the intersection of Highway 321 and Highway 301. After this point, the tornado rapidly intensified and moved through a large forest of mostly softwood pine, with hardwood oaks in the forest for some stretch. As it approached Popeye Rd in Bamberg County, the tornado strengthened into a strong EF3 with winds estimated at 160 mph. Remarkable damage was done to both softwoods and hardwoods in this forest, with an estimated 2 miles of 80-100 percent forest blowdown. In a particularly intense section, the tornado scoured the ground and stripped pine needles off of young pine trees. Additionally, many younger pine trees in this area were debarked and delimbed. On either side of this were sections of pine and oak that had been snapped low, at or below 5 feet, to the ground. Strong EF3 damage is estimated to have continued from Popeye Road across Kirkland Creek and then towards Wild Flower Road in Bamberg County. From here, the tornado weakened a bit as it approached Alligator road. The tornado was near its peak width at this time, then striking a more residential area along Carver road. Here, one mobile home was completely destroyed, with a home having its roof completely gone and some partial wall collapses. On either side of the center of the track, other homes sustained different degrees of damage to their roofs and siding. The tornado continued northeastward and maintained some EF2 strength as it did so, primarily to trees. Much of the damage on Macedonia Church Rd was from trees falling on homes. The tornado showed signs of weakening by this point as it approached Orangeburg county, and it is distinctly possible that there were multiple weak vortexes impacting only the tops of trees. EF0 and weak EF1 damage was noted until the county line with Orangeburg, where the tornado regained some of its strength and continued doing damage. The tornado approached the North Fork of the Edisto river and impacted a couple of homes, doing some significant tree damage on both properties. As the tornado approached Freedom Road in Orangeburg County, it produced EF0 and EF1 damage continuing to snap trees. The tornado continued to weaken gradually as it approached the city of Bowman, finally dissipating about 2 miles north of the city around 6:53 PM.", "F_scale": 3, "Wind": 160, "Source": null, "State_1": "GA", "State_2": null, "State_3": null }, "geometry": { "type": "LineString", "coordinates": [ [ -81.217950383, 33.099343195 ], [ -81.211598912, 33.102291148 ], [ -81.208423177, 33.103980785 ], [ -81.205590764, 33.105814183 ], [ -81.200269261, 33.109624653 ], [ -81.194776097, 33.11300361 ], [ -81.189818198, 33.115138359 ], [ -81.18356329, 33.116836734 ], [ -81.181460431, 33.118220571 ], [ -81.171139291, 33.121419487 ], [ -81.168457082, 33.123701789 ], [ -81.166547349, 33.125732448 ], [ -81.163308545, 33.127483108 ], [ -81.161613389, 33.127698747 ], [ -81.160797997, 33.127842505 ], [ -81.160088589, 33.128212305 ], [ -81.15740638, 33.130063167 ], [ -81.155088952, 33.132021803 ], [ -81.152438933, 33.133683915 ], [ -81.148662383, 33.134905771 ], [ -81.145583207, 33.137394352 ], [ -81.141483685, 33.140066196 ], [ -81.137020489, 33.142437846 ], [ -81.13148441, 33.145060961 ], [ -81.126162907, 33.147109093 ], [ -81.119124791, 33.150271026 ], [ -81.1131381, 33.153774171 ], [ -81.111893555, 33.154358015 ], [ -81.110659739, 33.154861015 ], [ -81.109468838, 33.155399942 ], [ -81.108170649, 33.155938865 ], [ -81.101702264, 33.159402198 ], [ -81.090630105, 33.16421624 ], [ -81.083935311, 33.168383406 ], [ -81.074837258, 33.175495869 ], [ -81.056555322, 33.18698954 ], [ -81.046684792, 33.191083795 ], [ -81.02642875, 33.199846296 ], [ -81.015785744, 33.204442667 ], [ -81.00273948, 33.213634685 ], [ -80.980766824, 33.225410548 ], [ -80.928581765, 33.254125515 ], [ -80.896652749, 33.275081484 ], [ -80.888756326, 33.281180736 ], [ -80.885323098, 33.283835571 ], [ -80.881417802, 33.287207813 ], [ -80.879486611, 33.288678644 ], [ -80.877598336, 33.290579925 ], [ -80.864594987, 33.298866156 ], [ -80.844338944, 33.30733093 ], [ -80.829232743, 33.313212747 ], [ -80.817731431, 33.317946603 ], [ -80.802110246, 33.323253956 ], [ -80.791123917, 33.328417555 ], [ -80.782025864, 33.335015043 ], [ -80.7765327, 33.338887249 ], [ -80.762456467, 33.343763115 ], [ -80.748380235, 33.348065124 ], [ -80.732587388, 33.352653698 ], [ -80.722974351, 33.356381737 ], [ -80.718167832, 33.358962593 ], [ -80.714734605, 33.362116869 ], [ -80.712331345, 33.364195761 ] ] } },

Video evidence taken on the ground during the tornadic event, and areal footage of the damage track show the parent circulation produced at least 3 small, brief tornadoes while the storm circulation was near and east of the county line. Scattered damage points and small paths are making it difficult to determine which areas may have been impacted by each of these smaller tornadoes before the parent tornado formed. Therefore, in the area just east of the Williamson/Bell County line, the damage extent of the tornadic track has been widened to include all the known damage points (all EF-0s or EF-1s). In this case, since it is too difficult to discern the smaller tracks, and because they all formed from the same parent circulation within a short amount of time of each other, they will all be considered one tornado. The maximum width listed will remain the maximum width of the parent tornado (the EF-3 tornado). The tornado which began in northern Williamson County entered extreme southern Bell county north of the junction between Bell County Road 231 and FM 2843. In this area there was a narrow swath of tree damage consistent with EF-0 intensity wind speeds, with some damage to outbuildings as well. The tornado moved east northeast and intersected FM 2843, where the damage to trees and structures became much more significant. At least 15-20 damaged homes were visible to the survey team on both sides of FM 2843, with the most significant damage concentrated near the junction of FM 2843 and Buttermilk Road. In this vicinity, at least 10 structures suffered EF-2 to EF-3 intensity damage, with a small cluster of homes experiencing estimated peak tornado wind speeds of 150 to 165 mph. These structures had all or most of their roofs removed, and some of them had one or more exterior walls collapsed. Two churches along FM 2843 in the vicinity of Buttermilk Road were seriously damaged, with roofing material removed and multiple walls collapsed. Numerous vehicles in the area had significant damage consistent with being rolled or having flying projectiles thrown into them. Many hardwood trees along the FM 2843 corridor in the tornado path were uprooted or snapped, and many power poles were also snapped. Beyond Buttermilk Road, the tornado continued traveling east- northeastward another 1.5 miles along FM 2843, then began a sharp turn to the northeast and eventually northerly direction. Aerial footage allowed us to track the damage through inaccessible areas where notable tree damage, damage to homes and barns was observed along the path of the tornado. The tornado reached Crows Ranch Rd and damaged aluminum panels of the roof of a home and blew in the panel garage door. It continued over a ridge line, then intensified shortly before crossing FM 2484. It uprooted many large trees, shifted a large barn's walls, lifted roof panels off a shed, and caused significant damage to a residence. The residence's roof was almost entirely removed from the structure, and a section of the south facing wall was blown in. The east facing wall was completely blown out, all consistent with a high-end EF2 rating in this location. The tornado then continued northwest into the South Shore neighborhood, and then into Union Grove Park where it lifted shortly after moving onto Stillhouse Hollow Lake.", "F_scale": 3, "Wind": 165, "Source": null, "State_1": "TX", "State_2": null, "State_3": null }, "geometry": { "type": "LineString", "coordinates": [ [ -97.788012111, 30.884611356 ], [ -97.783720577, 30.885421614 ], [ -97.777927006, 30.886231865 ], [ -97.774880016, 30.886452842 ], [ -97.769463359, 30.887741861 ], [ -97.759721576, 30.89179295 ], [ -97.751267254, 30.893339685 ], [ -97.745302021, 30.892897763 ], [ -97.737382734, 30.892308531 ], [ -97.732565487, 30.891682468 ], [ -97.730229412, 30.891795427 ], [ -97.701279964, 30.897948632 ], [ -97.693881426, 30.900121278 ], [ -97.687808905, 30.902772577 ], [ -97.684204016, 30.904429602 ], [ -97.6795648, 30.905515858 ], [ -97.669522609, 30.908130186 ], [ -97.657523077, 30.912751113 ], [ -97.64427967, 30.917242955 ], [ -97.635447826, 30.919580839 ], [ -97.631220665, 30.921476876 ], [ -97.627830352, 30.923998731 ], [ -97.625620212, 30.926078751 ], [ -97.623603191, 30.928729331 ], [ -97.622186985, 30.932705062 ], [ -97.6222299, 30.936680629 ], [ -97.622659053, 30.950078542 ], [ -97.624134939, 30.963474577 ], [ -97.625489455, 30.983247775 ], [ -97.623928409, 31.016722702 ] ] } },
