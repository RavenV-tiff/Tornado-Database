After a gap of more than 2 miles, the tornado redeveloped and caused damage along Watermelon Road. Minor roof damage occurred near this location. The tornado continued along JB Shackelford Road in mostly rural open farm fields before damage occurred along Johnson Young Road (Route 739). Several trees had large limbs down, and a hardwood tree was uprooted nearby. The strongest damage occurred as a nearby barn was completely demolished with estimated wind speeds at 110 mph for strong EF-1 winds.\nThe tornado then turned to the northeast causing minor damage to a porch covering at BL Shackelford Road. Damage continued toward Williams Store where significant tree damage occurred with several large trees either snapped or had large branches broken. The tornado then crossed rural areas west of Nashville Road (Highway 431).\nAt Nashville Road, a barn had roof damage observed with another outbuilding shifted off the foundation. At this point, the tornado appeared to strengthen with consistent damage just north of Ellis Road. A barn had a silo completely destroyed with major damage to 2 other silos, and drone footage confirmed several trees uprooted with branches snapped beyond this barn. The tornado then did some damage along Ellis road with roof damage observed at another barn.\nAn isolated tree snap occurred near the junction of Franklin Road (route 100) and Airport Road before the tornado crossed rural fields near the Russellville-Logan County Airport.

The tornado then continued downstream, crossing Hwy 289 and then following along Hwy 3211, Red Fern Rd. Several homes experienced damage here, again mostly with roof issues, but multiple trees were also uprooted and/or snapped.\nAdditional damage occurred along Palestine Rd and Sharp Ln, mostly roofing damage, but some of the debris falling downstream hit and broke off parts of a low brick wall. Two power poles in the area were bent roughly 30 degrees, with one cracked at the base but still standing.\nThe tornado caused its last damage along Old Spurlington Road near US Hwy 68. A two-story home had some roofing damage along the top ridge. A tree on the southwest side of the home surprisingly did not fall on the house, but a nearby air conditioner unit was pushed partly off its foundation.

Homes along Noland Road sustained roof, siding, and window damage, some of which occurred as a result of flying debris from damaged outbuildings. Nearby, along Union City Road, straight line winds estimated at 80 mph shifted mobile homes off foundations and overturned a small shed.\nMore extensive damage was observed as the tornado approached Walker Parke Road, where multiple hardwood trees were uprooted or snapped. One home had its chimney collapse, and a brick from the chimney was thrown through the window of a van parked on the south side of the home. A neighboring home lost its entire metal roof.\nThe most extensive damage occurred east-northeast of Union City along Doylesville Road. Many cedar trees were snapped and the roof of a home was damaged at a farm in a valley area, but the winds strengthened as the tornado reached another farm near the next ridge top. Here, three substantial outbuildings were completely destroyed, and one was shifted far enough off its foundation to be a total loss.

It was determined that a brief EF-1 tornado that was embedded within a larger area of straight-line winds touched down 1.3 miles southeast of Upton, traveled east for just over 2.5 miles, and then lifted 3 miles east-southeast of Upton. The EF-1 tornado had a max wind of around 100 mph, and a max path width of around 200 yards.\nThe tornado touched down at solid EF-1 strength just northwest of the intersection of Weldon Loop Road and Watkins Alvey Road where a small barn was completely destroyed, and debris was scattered in many directions almost a half mile to the northeast. In addition, a small lean-to section of another barn was thrown back to the northwest, clear evidence of cyclonic rotation. Hardwood trees just downstream from the barn were also snapped and laying in a convergent pattern, offering more support for tornadic winds.\nThe tornado continued roughly eastward along Weldon Loop Road where it did some light damage to a barn roof and brought down large limbs from a hardwood tree. This damage occurred near the intersection of Johnson Road and Weldon Loop Road, and was in the EF-0 strength range. The tornado continued to the ENE along Weldon Loop Road at EF- 0 strength as it caused minor roof damage to a house, and damaged a greenhouse near the intersection of Wheeler and Wheldon Loop Roads. The tornado finished the last half mile of its path along Upton Talley Road where it uprooted or snapped softwood trees, damaged barns, and did minor fascia and shingle damage to a couple of homes. The tornado lifted about a quarter mile past the Upton Talley and Lanny Heath Roads intersection.\nIt should be noted that this brief tornado occurred within a larger area of straight-line wind damage where some older barns were destroyed and numerous softwood and hardwood trees were snapped or uprooted. However, the damage was mainly laying in an east-northeast direction consistent with overall storm motion and a straight-line wind signature. It was considered to make this damage part of the overall tornado, however the path width would have been over a half mile wide, which is unlikely for brief spin-up tornadoes embedded in a QLCS.\nIt should also be noted that more sporadic, and overall weaker, straight-line wind damage continued eastward along a consistent path across southern Larue county. Most of this damage was consistent with winds between 60 and 70 mph toward and just north of the Magnolia community and points eastward.", "f_scale": 1, "wind": 100, "source": "NWS Storm Survey", "state_1": "KY", "state_2": null, "state_3": null, "spc_id": 621358, "ncei_id": "1022463", "tornado_type": "Tornado", "storm_morphology": "QLCS", "sub_morphology": null, "satellite_scar": null, "tds": null, "tropical_cyclone": null }, "geometry": { "type": "LineString", "coordinates": [ [ -85.877403819, 37.448714524 ], [ -85.871653163, 37.448782665 ], [ -85.855860316, 37.444012661 ], [ -85.829424464, 37.452257762 ] ] } },

Several trees fell down in the Hillview area near the Bullitt County line. All of the trees were facing from the west southwest to the east northeasterly direction.\nThe tornado initially touched down just east of Beulah Church Rd, near Adams Run Road which is just south of I-265. Trees were facing from the northeast through the southeast primarily in a 100 yard swath with a lot of straight line winds surrounding the 80 mph twister. Two barns sustained roof panel damage.\nThe tornado became very intermittent along Cedar Creek Road to Gentry Lane with tops of pine and cedar trees sheared off and with shingle and sporadic roof damage on some homes. Winds were 75 to 80 mph in this area.\nThe tornado increased to EF1 in the Glenmary Reserves subdivision. The tornado drone video showing a distinct swirl in the trees from the north through the southeasterly directions. Trees were snapped, uprooted, and laying on top of power lines. Winds were around 90 mph in this area, with a width of 150 yards. There was extensive shingle damage, gutter damage, flashing, at several homes. The tornado increased in width to 175 yards and speed along Providence Road. There was more extensive damage to the roofing structures of several homes. One house in particular had wind enter its roof soffit, blowing building material out the western side. The house insulation was thrown around three sides of the home. Wind speeds in this area were estimated to be 97 mph with a width of 125 yards. A Ford Ranger, parked in another driveway was picked up and slid 11 yards, with house insulation on three sides of the truck.\nThere were several road signs twisted and mangled too. The tornado continued towards the entrance of the Glenmary Reserves subdivision off Bardstown Road. There was extensive tree damage, especially cedars and pines, facing from the north-northeast, through the southeasterly direction. Trees were uprooted, snapped, and slightly sheared off. The 88-D radar showed a distinct debris ball in the area we found the tornado.\nThe tornado crossed Bardstown Road striking at least two vehicles, thankfully there were no injuries. The tornado continued in the Glenmary subdivision with numerous homes having shingle and roof damamge along with plenty of trees down. One home in particular had the 85-90 mph wind get in through the attached garage. This caused a massive structural failure in the roofing structure, with roof decking and insulation thrown up into the trees from a northerly to a southeasterly direction. Insulation was thrown around three sides of the house.\nThe owner of the house described intense ear pressure when the tornado went over his house.The tornado weakened by the far eastern part of the Glenmary subdivision lifted at that point. There was still one and two story home damage. Most of the damage to the homes was related to shingle, flashing, and siding. Winds were generally around 80 mph. Wind speeds, along the sporadic tree damage, at the end point were 75 mph by Hidden Valley Way with a width of 100 yards.\nSouth Louisville (Big Run Creek to Turkey Run Park)...\nVery sporadic tree damage was found with drones and binoculars around the park. Park Rangers took us through the park and it was very hard to find more than isolated damage points here and there. Winds were EFO with winds in the 75-80 mph range.\nThe tornado really became more distinct on the eastern entrance of Turkey Run Park and especially along Echo Trail Road. At 7401 Echo Trail numerous trees were topped, sheared off, and twisted, and facing from north northeast to east southeast. Winds were 80 to 85 mph in this area. Shingle and gutter damage was noted along Echo Trail and then it headed into the hilly rugged area of Echo Trail Rd and Hickory Valley Road. Larger hardwood trees were snapped and uprooted, an outbuilding lost its roof and 2 deer stands were destroyed. Wind in this area were 90 mph EF1 with a width of 75 yards.

The first damage noted was along Barterbrook Road one-half mile north of Tinkling Spring Road where there were broken tree branches and both hardwood and softwood trees were snapped. As the tornado progressed east, additional trees were snapped and uprooted along with significant damage to a farm on the 1100 block of Tinkling Spring Road. At this farm, significant roof and structural damage was observed to a barn. A farmhouse lost portions of its metal roof which became dislodged and were wrapped around branches of a tree. Lumber from the barn was lofted approximately 125 yards and embedded into the ground in different directions. Trees on the farm were noted to be snapped in multiple directions. The tornado continued eastward towards the intersection of Tinkling Spring Road and Ramsey Road where more hardwood tree branches and entire softwood trees were snapped. Some screens were also damaged on homes and some siding was dislodged at this location. The tornado crossed Tinkling Spring Road where additional hardwood trees were uprooted and softwood trees were snapped. Siding and roof damage occurred to a mobile home and two 75-yard sections of fence were blown inward at a plumbing supply facility. A trash dumpster and grease dumpster were flipped sideways, and minor structural damage was observed to an office complex near the intersection of Tinkling Spring Road and Ivy Ridge Road. Sporadic damage continued near Ivy Ridge road. As the tornado moved east through Ivy Ridge, the tornado produced scattered tree and structural damage throughout the area. The tornado then paralleled Ladd Road and crossed Interstate 64 near Hickory Hill Road. The tornado continued moving east into a wooded area between Hickory Hill Road and Lew Dewitt Boulevard. The survey team noted scattered uprooted and snapped trees.\nAfter this point, the tornado moved into the City of Waynesboro.\nIt was noted that significant leaf debris occurred on all sides of multiple structures along the entire path of the tornado.

The tornado had estimated peak winds of 105 mph (EF-1), with a max path width of 130 yards and a path length of just over 3 miles. The tornado touched down on the 400 block of Maple Shade Rd, where it uprooted 2 large hardwood trees and 1 large softwood tree at a private residence. The tornado moved ENE and downed several large tree limbs and did minor siding damage to a building at the corner of Maple Shade Rd and Kirkwood Pike. A crop field behind the post office on the north side of Kirkwood Pike showed a clear pattern of convergence within the crops blown down by the tornado as it continued moving towards the NE. The tornado then destroyed a small shed constructed with cinder block walls, carrying contents from inside the shed toward the NNE. Large limbs from trees to the southeast of the shed were knocked down and facing the NW, towards the centerline of the tornado track. A second small shed behind property on the 300 block of Maple Shade Rd was destroyed, with debris carried over 200 yards toward the N and NE. The tornado intensified to EF-1 strength as it moved northeast and caused near complete destruction of a large barn on a property on Farmdale Rd. Three of the 4 barn walls were removed, as well as all of the roof, with debris carried more than 200 yards toward the NE. A second large barn was partially destroyed, with one wall completely removed, two walls partially removed, and half of the roof removed. There was one minor injury of scratches due to flying debris. Two large hardwood trees were downed on the property, pointing north toward the centerline of the tornado track. The tornado continued moving northeast, putting a dent into the southeast side of one large silo before causing crop damage in a large field. The pattern of crop damage was strongly convergent, with crops on the right periphery of the tornado track laying towards the WNW and crops on the left periphery of the tornado track laying towards the ESE. The tornado crossed over E Salem Rd near Ridge Rd, where it downed several large trees and snapped several others. Several more trees were uprooted farther north along Ridge Rd. The tornado then approached Rosedale Rd, uprooting and snapping a couple dozen trees on a private residence near Coopers Run. After crossing Rosedale Rd, the tornado then destroyed two barns and a shed. Wooden beams from one of the barns were carried by the tornado as projectiles that penetrated through the NW facing wall of another barn on the property. A house on the property was also damaged, with some siding dented, broken, or removed, and the partial collapse of a basement wall on the NW facing side of the house. The collapse of the basement wall caused minor cuts and scratches to at least two people taking shelter in the basement. The top of a farm silo was also removed. The tornado continued to produce significant damage as it hit another farm on Highland Rd. Two barns had their roofs completely removed. A third barn lost about half of its roof. A fourth structure, which appeared to be a shed without walls, collapsed. Two silos were also damaged, including the removal of the top of one of the silos. The intensity of the tornado decreased as it approached one more farm on Rynear Rd near Bells Run. The tornado partially removed the roof from one barn on the property.

The majority of the damage was trees uprooted with several snapped along the way. Aerial imagery provided by the Pine County Sheriff's Department shows fairly weak but convergent tree fall between I-35 and near Highway 61 and Owl Drive between a distinct intensification where the treefall becomes much more extensive and a metal roof section was lifted off a local business. The tornado then tracked across Highway 61 and traversed north causing mainly tree damage with at least one home losing some roof shingles.
