A ceiling tile was removed from a nearby building and landed on the tracks of the Silver Line of the Metro, temporarily blocking service between the Tysons Corner Center and McLean Metro stops.\nBased on a lack of damage displayed further southeast, it is concluded that the tornado over the northwest Tysons Corner Center Mall parking garage on Tysons One Place.", "f_scale": 0, "wind": 85, "source": "NWS Storm Survey", "state_1": "VA", "state_2": null, "state_3": null, "spc_id": 621218, "ncei_id": "1006547", "tornado_type": "Tornado", "storm_morphology": "Supercell", "sub_morphology": null, "satellite_scar": null, "tds": null, "tropical_cyclone": null }, "geometry": { "type": "LineString", "coordinates": [ [ -77.22568545, 38.91963987 ], [ -77.22462061, 38.919863163 ] ] } },

The origin of this severe thunderstorm was the result of a cell merger of two separate thunderstorms that approached Saint Mary's County: one crossing eastward over the Potomac River from near Quantico in Virginia moving toward Charles County, Maryland; and the other one crossing northeast over the Potomac River near Colonial Beach. The cells merged over Charles County between La Plata and Dentsville, then proceeded due east toward northern Saint Mary's County where the tornado occurred.\nThe severe thunderstorm damaged over two dozen trees and large branches in an approximately three mile radius of the intersection of MD-5 Point Lookout Road and MD-235 Three Notch Road. Most of this damage was sporadic and isolated in areal extent, but included tree trunk snapps and uproots, with estimated wind speeds between 60 and 70 MPH based on the observed tree damage. However, there were two areas of more concentrated damage that helped lead to the determination of a tornado in this area of southern Maryland.\nThe tornado initially touched down around an enclave of residential houses 200 yards southwest of the intersection of MD-5 and MD-235. Here, there was a mix of about a dozen uprooted and trunk snaps of both hardwood and softwood trees. One of the trees fell onto the roof of a residence, causing roof damage; fortunately, there were no injuries despite a resident being inside the home when it fell. The trees fell to the north, east, southeast, east, west, and northwest. Due to the localized but prolific damage in this enclave, wind estimates are up to 85 MPH. It is believed that the tornado went right over this enclave of residences due to the random direction of tree falls.\nThe tornado may have lifted as it moved to the east-northeast. However, tornadic damage was noted about 3 miles further east along Delabrooke Road, where a chaotic mix of downed trees and branches were observed on both sides of the 40900 block in a deeply forested area. Residents in this area received the mobile phone alert before the damage occurred, and also reported half dollar size hail.\nFinally, a certified NWS SKYWARN Spotter filmed a video from MD-235, showing an earthward extension of the cloud base.
