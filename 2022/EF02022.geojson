Winds lifted upwards under the canopy and caused the northwest corner of the canopy to collapse on the service station building.\nA group of bushes separating the two service stations experienced significant vegetation loss on the southeast facing side. A Mobil gas station about 120 feet from the Sunoco gas station experienced a number of impacts to the building and surrounding objects. A garage door facing northwest was blown 10 to 15 feet away from the building. Metal paneling at the top of the roof along the northwest and southeast facing sides of the building were damaged and tossed away from the building. A small canopy hanging over the entrance of the service station was mangled beyond repair. A video posted on social media displayed a number of loose items, including packs of water and other small items tossed around in a rotating fashion in the front of the building. Flying debris also cause at least 6 to 8 windows in the front of the Mobil station to shatter.\nEyewitness accounts along wiht a video posted on social media show the tornado as it passed the Mobil gas station and was approximately 100 yards away with clear rotation evident in the video as it approached the entrance to Tysons Corner Center Mall on Tysons One Place. A ceiling tile was removed from a nearby building and landed on the tracks of the Silver Line of the Metro, temporarily blocking service between the Tysons Corner Center and McLean Metro stops.\nBased on a lack of damage displayed further southeast, it is concluded that the tornado over the northwest Tysons Corner Center Mall parking garage on Tysons One Place.", "F_scale": 0, "Wind": 85, "Source": "NWS Storm Survey", "State_1": "VA", "State_2": null, "State_3": null }, "geometry": { "type": "LineString", "coordinates": [ [ -77.22568545, 38.91963987 ], [ -77.22462061, 38.919863163 ] ] } },

The tornado then tracked north-northeast, crossing CR-34 and directly hitting an open-walled chicken house. While most of the roof was gone, the open walls allowed for the tornado to more easily loft the roof and cause damage, so a lower-end estimate of 70 mph was given. This was the maximum width of the weak tornado, as roughly two-thirds of the building had roof damage. The tornado then continued north-northeast, uprooting a few trees before eventually lifting. Due to waterlogged soils from antecedent heavy rainfall, a low-end wind estimate of 73 mph was provided for the tree uprooting.

Farther northeast down Kennard-Kingscreek Rd, a front porch was completely separated from the home and had large 20ft pieces of structure thrown as far as 50-70 yards away. The damage path continues past N Ludlow Rd down S Kennard Rd where metal roofing was lifted off of a barn. More damage was found along a treeline off of Dog Leg Rd, where numerous tree branches were snapped and trees were uprooted. The last known damage from the tornado occurred along State Route 296, where several trees were downed. Additional damage was surveyed in northeastern Champaign County near Woodstock, and in far southwestern Union County. At these locations, the damage found was very minor. One tree was uprooted in wet ground, and other damage consisted primarily of snapped tree limbs.

Most\nof these damage reports were sporadic and isolated in \nareal extent, but included tree trunk snaps and uproots, \nwith estimated wind speeds between 60 and 70 mph based on\ntree damage.  However, there were two areas of more \nconcentrated damage that helped lead to the likely\ndetermination of a tornado in this area of southern \nMaryland.\n\nThe tornado initially touch downed aroud an enclave of \nresidential houses 200 yards southwest of the intersection\nof Route 5 and Route 235.  Here there was a mix of about \na dozen uprooted and trunk snaps of both hardwood and \nsoftwood trees.

The trees fell to the north, east, southeast, \neast, west, and northwest.
