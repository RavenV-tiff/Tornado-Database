The tornado began northwest of Macksburg in western Madision county. The tornado remained in mostly rural cropland and wooded areas of western Madison county. The tornado passed through Pammel State Park southwest of Winterset producing extensive tree damage as the tornado continued to widen into a wedge tornado. Upon exiting the park, the tornado travelled along Carver Road. Several residential homes were extensively damaged or destroyed along Carver Road and six deaths occurred along this stretch of road. The tornado was at peak intensity at this time with EF4 damage occurring west of the intersection of Carver Road and Highway 169 with a house completely destoyed and removed from the foundation. After departing the Carver Road corridor, the tornado progressed just southeast of Winterset and eventually passed east of town and crossing State Highway 92. Damage in these areas was primarily to trees and outbuildings although a few homes were also impacted with mostly EF1 to EF2 damage. From Highway 92 to where the tornado exited the county, it remained mostly in rural cropland and wooded areas with numerous trees impacted. The tornado then moved into Warren county from Madison county. This is a continuation of the tornado which started in Madison county and passed into Warren county. The tornado remained very broad with a maximum width of up to 500 yards at times. Video evidence supports a multi-vortex circulation with the tornado across much of Warren county. The tornado cross Interstate 35 shortly after entering the county but fortunately, no vehicles were impacted. The tornado remained in rural areas to the west southwest of Norwalk producing mostly tree and outbuilding damage. The tornado passed along the southeast edge of Norwalk producing EF0 to EF1 damage along Coolidge Street and along Highway G14 near Warrior Run Golf Course. The tornado crossed Highway 5 just west of the intersections of Highway 5 and Highway 69 approaching the southeast side of Des Moines. The tornado entered into Polk county shortly after crossing Highway 69 near the intersection of Highway 69 and Indianola Avenue. This tornado passed from Warren county into Polk county near the intersection of Highway 69 and County Line Road. The tornado crossed E Pine Avenue removing the roof of a house and then clipped the north edge of Avon producing EF2 damage to a couple of houses. The tornado then crossed the Des Moines River and impacted the Woodland Hills neighborhood damaging muliple structures. The damage continued to the northeast into less inhabited areas of eastern Polk county, however the tornado remained strong with EF2 damage at several locations along its path. The tornado crossed University Avenue near its intersection with NE 112th Street and then exited the county into Jasper county. The tornado moved into Jasper county from Polk county. The tornado remained largely in rural areas for much of its path across Jasper county. Despite its rural venture, the tornado impacted several residences in western Jasper county producing several areas of EF2 damage. The tornado did pass not far from the southeast side of Colfax damaging structures near the intersection of Highway 117 and S 44th Avenue West. The tornado crossed Interstate 80 east of Colfax near mile marker 160 and then proceeded towards Newton, grazing both the communities of Lambs Grove and Newton on the north sides. Most of the damage was to trees and minor damage to structures including loss of shingles and broken windows. The tornado did remove about a 100 foot segment of the roof of the former TPI Composites Plant northeast of Newton with the tornado dissipating shortly thereafter.

As the storm began to cycle the tornado began to move northeast and then more north. Another grove of trees was heavily impacted before another house was hit along with a four person ATV being thrown. Two large trees, estimated over 300 years old, were snapped or fully uprooted. The tornado then crossed Hwy 80 before impacting one more house, damaging an old RV, and causing more tree damage.

The tornado tracked to that interchange moving into Williamson County and then moved northeastward across the county and into Bell County approximately 0.8 miles east of CR 352. Touchdown was found near the Silverstone subdivision where some shingles were torn off roofs and fences blown down. This was rated weak EF0 damage. The tornado quickly strengthened to EF1 as it continued to cross a residential area and business park where a section of roof was lifted off a warehouse building and several empty semi-trailers were tipped over. Several trees were snapped and air conditioning units were blown off the roofs of several buildings. The tornado crossed the I-35/Hwy 45 intersection and entered a large retail shopping center where roof and window damage was observed on several businesses. Still an EF1, the tornado crossed Dell Way and entered the Windy Terrace and Greenlawn Place neighborhoods. Widespread tree and roof damage was observed to multiple homes, a few lost their entire roof indicating the tornado had strengthened briefly to EF2. The tornado likely weakened a bit before regaining EF2 strength as it moved northeast and crossed Gattis School Rd. where substantial roof damage was seen on some homes near the intersection of Gattis School Rd. and windy Park Dr. The Clay Madsen Recreation Center and the adjacent playing fields sustained damage as well. The storm crossed A.W.Grimes Blvd. and entered the South Creek neighborhood where tree and roof damage was once again observed across many streets until it exited the neighborhood at Brushy Creek. Before crossing Hwy 79 the tornado made a slight right turn and started to parallel the south side of Hwy 79 and moved through the parking lot of the Kalahari Resort where multiple vehicles were damaged, trees blown down, and some windows of the resort were broken from flying debris. The tornado was likely at high end EF1 strength when it followed Brushy Creek into the Forest Bluff neighborhood off Red Bud Ln. Trees were blown down along the creek and several homes sustained roof damage where large sections of roof were blown off the house. The tornado crossed Red Bud Ln. and damaged a few businesses at the Red Bud Ln. and CR123 intersection. Shortly after crossing Hwy 79 east of Red Bud Ln., the tornado produced EF1 damage to an industrial park complex to numerous metal warehouse buildings. The tornado then weakened and continued to the northeast for nearly 5 miles producing minor EF0 damage to residential roofs, trees, and signs. Just east of FM1660, several homes under construction with only visible studs collapsed. As the tornado approached Chandler Rd. near the intersection with CR 101, the intensity of the tornado increased again with EF1 damage observed to a large metal building system with sections of the roof peeled away. Additional EF1 damage was observed to a stable on a property near the San Gabriel River with substantial tree damage as well. As the tornado neared CR337, EF2 damage was observed to a home on piers as the roof, most exterior walls, and some interior walls failed and were moved away from the property. As the tornado crossed Hwy 95 and CR345 EF1 damage was found on more homes and metal system buildings. Significant EF2 damage occurred to a home near the intersection of CR347 and CR346. The tornado then produced EF1 damage to trees, power poles, and a few structures as it crossed CR348, FM971, CR352, and CR357 before exiting Williamson County and entering Bell County. The maximum width of the tornado and its damage path was roughly 500 yards with maximum winds at 135 mph, the high end of EF2. Most of the 29-mile-long track however was at EF1 strength. There were reports of a total of 16 injuries, most of which were minor. There were no reported fatalities with this tornado. This tornado crossed the Williamson/Bell County line moving towards the north-northeast, crossing Alligator Rd where some power poles and trees were damaged. The tornado continued northeast, damaging more trees and power poles near FM-487 and along Donahoe Rd. It is believed to have lifted just as it was crossing FM-2268 east of the town of Vilas.

The tornado began to intensify and develop a widespread damage swath of uprooted and snapped trees as it approached Highway 271 several miles south of Gilmer. Prior to reaching Highway 271, the tornado ripped the roof off of a single family home and tore down a wall of the home. As the tornado continued on, it reached its maximum width of 700 yards or 0.4 miles as it crossed Highway 700. The tornado intensified further as it crossed Azalea Road and Highway 154. Just before reaching this road, the tornado hit a two-story single family home, removing the home's second floor and tearing down a front exterior wall. This led to the tornado's estimated maximum wind speed of 135 mph, the strongest EF-2 rating on the Enhanced Fujita Scale. A nearby mobile home was also destroyed, with an occupant injured.\nThe tornado continued to track northeast and ripped off a roof of a single family home, and completely destroyed one double-wide and multiple single-wide manufactured homes. The tornado also led to structural damage to several two-story family homes with portions of the roofs removed and a projectile leading to a large hole in the side of a home. A guest house that had a frame nailed into the ground was wiped clean from its foundation with its occupant hospitalized.\nAs the tornado continued to track northeast, it led to more structural damage to single family homes and complete destruction to manufactured homes between Gilmer and Ore City. On at least three occasions, manufactured homes had residents inside of them when they were picked up and thrown by the tornado. Additional widespread tree and roof damage to homes continued as the tornado approached Lake O' the Pines. Before crossing the lake into Western Marion County, the tornado ripped the roof off of the Lake O' the Pines Bait Shop before throwing multiple RV's and a motor home into the lake. Four occupants in these RV's were injured but were rescued from the lake. This is a continuation of the Upshur County EF-2 tornado. This tornado, which had weakened to an EF-1 with estimated maximum winds near 110 mph as it entered far Western Marion County, continued to track northeast across Jordan Drive and FM 729. The tornado damaged the roof of a home on Jordan Drive, with a metal building structure for storage of vehicles having two walls and its roof removed, lifting pillars and throwing them several hundred feet. Widespread tree damage was observed with hundreds of snapped trees. Off of FM 729, a manufactured home was picked up and rolled with an occupant in it. She suffered injuries and walked nearly a half mile to FM 729 to get to help. The tornado also significantly damaged or destroyed manufactured homes along Nash Farm Road. Winds from this tornado also caused three wooden power poles to lean significantly off of Morris County Cutoff Road, before the tornado crossed over into extreme Southeast Morris County. This is a continuation of the Upshur/Marion County EF-2 tornado. This tornado, which remained an EF-1 with estimated maximum winds near 110 mph from far Western Marion County, snapped numerous trees in far Southeast Morris County along and east of Morris County Cutoff Road/County Road 2307, before entering Southwestern Cass County. This is a continuation of the Upshur/Western Marion/Southeast Morris County EF-2 tornado. This tornado, which maintained an EF-1 rating with estimated maximum winds around 105 mph, continued to uproot and snap trees and Southwest and Central Cass County with damage becoming more sporadic and narrow as it tracked northeast across FM 161, County Road 1599, Highway 49, County Road 1577, Highway 11, before finally lifting just east of Highway 130.

As the tornado crossed Highway 241, it uprooted trees, and damaged two metal outbuildings just off of County Road 2525. The tornado continued to uproot and snap trees in more rural areas unreachable by vehicles, before crossing over into Northwest Nacogdoches County. The damage across Southern Cherokee County was consistent with EF-1 tornado winds up to 100 mph, although the tornado strengthened to an EF-2 shortly after crossing over into Northwest Nacogdoches County. This is a continuation of the Southern Cherokee County tornado. This tornado intensified to EF-2 with estimated maximum winds around 125 mph near the intersection of County Roads 885 and 886, where the damage width broadened to near a half mile with widespread snapping of hardwood and softwood trees. The tornado maintained its intensity as it tore through the Lilbert community and approached the west side of Cushing. Widespread trees were snapped on the west side of Cushing, with single family homes sustaining partial to complete loss of their roofs. Estimated maximum winds from this tornado reached 125 mph given the total loss of roofs of single family homes on the west and north side of Cushing, as well as the collapse of exterior walls on a home off of FM 225 and County Road 967. It was estimated that approximately 30 homes were damaged in Cushing, with a total of approximately 50 structures damaged. A wooden church off of County Road 967 was completely destroyed. The tornado continued northeast along FM 225 before crossing over into Southern Rusk County.\nOne injury was documented from this tornado as it tore through Northwest Nacogdoches County. This is a continuation of the Northwest Nacogdoches County EF-2 tornado. The tornado maintained its high end EF-1/low end EF-2 intensity as it moved through Southern and Eastern Rusk County, with estimated maximum winds near 125 mph. Upon departing FM 225 just inside the Southern Rusk County line, the tornado tracked northeast and crossed County Roads 3238 and 3227 before reaching Highway 84. Numerous trees were snapped and uprooted along the tornado's path through Highway 84, with the tornado tearing down a large metal electrical transmission tower off of County Road 3206 northeast of the Sulphur Springs community, while also ripping the roof off of a nearby single family home. The tornado continued northeast snapping and uprooting additional trees, while also damaging the roofs off of several homes as it crossed County Road 3167, FM 2496, County Roads 3155 and 3146. As the tornado crossed Highway 259 and County Road 317, it damaged or destroyed several metal buildings, while also destroying a single-wide mobile home. The tornado also destroyed another single-wide mobile home on FM 95 in the Minden community, while also significantly damaging a nearby single family home. The tornado then crossed FM 1798 and County Road 3125, snapping and uprooting additional trees before crossing FM 840. Here, several metal buildings were destroyed, with damage to roofs and walls on a couple of homes. The tornado crossed County Road 366 before finally lifting just east of County Road 364 about 10 miles east-southeast of Henderson.\nIn Rusk County, around 50 structures were damaged.

The most intense damage was from the riverbank to the canal in Arabi. It was a very narrow, intense tornado with two areas of concentrated EF3 damage. One was a house that was swept off its raised foundation with all walls and the roof destroyed. This was near where the one fatality occurred. Due to poor construction, this was EF3. The highest EF3 rating was given to a house that was constructed in the last 6 months. While this house was raised on cinder blocks, every tower of blocks had strapping to the house. The house had additional strapping directly into the foundation, as well as strapping from the cinder blocks to the foundation. The house itself held together but was shifted about 50 yards to the north and rotated about 90 degrees. The house next door was also swept off the foundation, moved and mostly destroyed.

A bus was also overturned in the parking lot with minor structural damage to the backside of the school. The tornado continued tracking northeast, both widening and strengthening impacting several homes and snapping/uprooting multiple trees and snapping powerlines as it crossed Highway 17. This was the strongest point along the tornado path with near 110mph winds. The tornado continued tracking northeast causing more sporadic EF0 to EF1 damage along the rest of its path to the Marengo County border with damage generally limited to a few snapped/uprooted softwood and hardwood trees, along with minor roof damage to a few homes. The tornado began to strengthen and widen again as it approached the Tombigbee River with the last accessible damage point on Ararat Road where there was notable snapped softwood/hardwood trees. The tornado crossed into Marengo County before briefly crossing back into Choctaw County before again moving back into Marengo County. National Weather Service meteorologists surveyed damage in southwest Marengo County and determined that it was consistent with an EF2 tornado, with maximum winds near 125 mph. This tornado originated in Choctaw County before crossing into extreme southwest Marengo County. A corridor of uprooted softwood trees was first observed near the Marengo County line where the trees were toppled across Blue Rock Road. The tornado tracked northeast near the intersection of Highway 69 and County Road 9. This area contained the highest degree and widest swath of damage noted on the survey where the tornado was likely at its strongest. There were considerable and continuous swaths of uprooted hardwood and softwood trees in addition to multiple snapped trunks. A manufactured home on County Road 9 was completely destroyed as the undercarriage rolled at least 30 yards from its foundation. A brick home next door also sustained roof damage not only from the winds, but also from a tree which fell onto the bedroom. The tornado continued northeast where it removed large portions of the roof and exterior walls from a single family residence on Highway 10.

The double wide home was the site of the two fatalities, and one person in the single wide was injured when he was thrown into the tree line grasping his mattress. Several projectiles were driven into the ground at this location. A large boat was also thrown from its trailer and overturned. Damage at this location was consistent with strong EF-2 winds. The tornado continued to strengthen as it moved across Jewel Rd and at that location, a well-built brick home was partially destroyed and likely was sideswiped by the tornado. The end of the home that was hit sustained major collapse of roof and exterior brick walls as well as a generator ripped from its anchoring and thrown across a field. The other end of the home was less severely damaged but still suffered major roof loss. A car in the driveway was pushed off of the driveway, and an attached carport was destroyed. Across the street, a wood frame home with block foundation was completely destroyed and swept from the foundation, leaving only some cinder blocks and a floor joist. The debris from the house was thrown into a pole barn which was also destroyed. An injury occurred at this site when the home occupant ran to the barn and dove under his pickup truck. The damage to this home and the brick home are consistent with EF3 damage and maximum winds of 150 mph. The tornado weakened some as it moved northeast, inflicting roof damage to a home and damage to out buildings along Archie Sapp Rd. On Syfrett Rd, several sheds and outbuildings were destroyed, a single wide manufactured home was flipped onto its side, and a brick home sustained major roof damage.

Near this location, the tornado threw a grain silo and flipped and threw a few farm trailers and vehicles, consistent with an EF-1 tornado rating. The tornado continued northeast across Wells Branch Road, where it widened to approximately 465 yards and downed many trees before crossing into Bamberg County near the intersection of Highway 321 and Highway 301 at 506 PM. A National Weather Service survey team confirmed a EF3 tornado that began in eastern Allendale County and then moved into Bamberg County near the intersection of Hwy 321 and Hwy 301. The tornado then crossed into Orangeburg county just north of Hwy 78. In Bamberg county the tornado moved through a large forest of mostly softwood pine, with hardwood oaks in the forest for some stretch. As it approached Popeye Rd, the tornado strengthened into a strong EF3 with winds estimated at 160 mph. Remarkable damage was done to both softwoods and hardwoods in this forest, with an estimated 2 miles of 80-100% forest blowdown. In a particularly intense section, the tornado scoured the ground and stripped pine needles off of young pine trees. Additionally, many younger pine trees in this area were debarked and delimbed. On either side of this were sections of pine and oak that had been snapped low, at or below 5 feet, to the ground. Strong EF3 damage is estimated to have continued from Popeye Road across Kirkland Creek and then towards Wild Flower Road in Bamberg County. From here, the tornado weakened a bit as it approached Alligator road. The tornado was near its peak width at this time, then striking a more residential area along Carver road. Here, one mobile home was completely destroyed, with a home having its roof completely removed and some partial wall collapses. On either side of the center of the track, other homes sustained different degrees of damage to their roofs and siding. The tornado continued northeastward and maintained EF2 strength, primarily causing damage to trees. Much of the damage on Macedonia Church Rd was from trees falling on homes. The tornado showed signs of weakening by this point as it approached Orangeburg county, and it is distinctly possible that there were multiple weak vortexes impacting only the tops of trees. EF0 and weak EF1 damage was noted until the county line with Orangeburg. A National Weather Service survey team confirmed a tornado that began in eastern Allendale County, moved across Bamberg County, and then crossed into Orangeburg County just north of Hwy 78. At its strongest, the tornado was an EF3 in Bamberg County, but produced EF1 damage in Orangeburg County. In Orangeburg County, the tornado approached the North Fork of the Edisto river and impacted a couple of homes, resulting in significant tree damage on both properties. As the tornado approached Freedom Road in Orangeburg County, it produced EF0 and EF1 damage as it continued to snap trees. The tornado continued to weaken gradually as it approached Bowman, finally dissipating about 2 miles north of the town.", "F_scale": 3.0, "Wind": 160.0, "Source": "NWS Storm Survey", "State_1": "SC", "State_2": null, "State_3": null, "SPC_id": 621287.0, "NCEI_id": "1014514, 1011033, 1011034", "Tornado_type": "Tornado", "Storm_morphology": "Supercell" }, "geometry": { "type": "LineString", "coordinates": [ [ -81.217950383, 33.099343195 ], [ -81.211598912, 33.102291148 ], [ -81.208423177, 33.103980785 ], [ -81.205590764, 33.105814183 ], [ -81.200269261, 33.109624653 ], [ -81.194776097, 33.11300361 ], [ -81.189818198, 33.115138359 ], [ -81.18356329, 33.116836734 ], [ -81.181460431, 33.118220571 ], [ -81.171139291, 33.121419487 ], [ -81.168457082, 33.123701789 ], [ -81.166547349, 33.125732448 ], [ -81.163308545, 33.127483108 ], [ -81.161613389, 33.127698747 ], [ -81.160797997, 33.127842505 ], [ -81.160088589, 33.128212305 ], [ -81.15740638, 33.130063167 ], [ -81.155088952, 33.132021803 ], [ -81.152438933, 33.133683915 ], [ -81.148662383, 33.134905771 ], [ -81.145583207, 33.137394352 ], [ -81.141483685, 33.140066196 ], [ -81.137020489, 33.142437846 ], [ -81.13148441, 33.145060961 ], [ -81.126162907, 33.147109093 ], [ -81.119124791, 33.150271026 ], [ -81.1131381, 33.153774171 ], [ -81.111893555, 33.154358015 ], [ -81.110659739, 33.154861015 ], [ -81.109468838, 33.155399942 ], [ -81.108170649, 33.155938865 ], [ -81.101702264, 33.159402198 ], [ -81.090630105, 33.16421624 ], [ -81.083935311, 33.168383406 ], [ -81.074837258, 33.175495869 ], [ -81.056555322, 33.18698954 ], [ -81.046684792, 33.191083795 ], [ -81.02642875, 33.199846296 ], [ -81.015785744, 33.204442667 ], [ -81.00273948, 33.213634685 ], [ -80.980766824, 33.225410548 ], [ -80.928581765, 33.254125515 ], [ -80.896652749, 33.275081484 ], [ -80.888756326, 33.281180736 ], [ -80.885323098, 33.283835571 ], [ -80.881417802, 33.287207813 ], [ -80.879486611, 33.288678644 ], [ -80.877598336, 33.290579925 ], [ -80.864594987, 33.298866156 ], [ -80.844338944, 33.30733093 ], [ -80.829232743, 33.313212747 ], [ -80.817731431, 33.317946603 ], [ -80.802110246, 33.323253956 ], [ -80.791123917, 33.328417555 ], [ -80.782025864, 33.335015043 ], [ -80.7765327, 33.338887249 ], [ -80.762456467, 33.343763115 ], [ -80.748380235, 33.348065124 ], [ -80.732587388, 33.352653698 ], [ -80.722974351, 33.356381737 ], [ -80.718167832, 33.358962593 ], [ -80.714734605, 33.362116869 ], [ -80.712331345, 33.364195761 ] ] } },

At this area significant tree damage was observed with several large mature oak trees uprooted. The damage in this area was rated EF1. The tornado continued east and crossed CR228 where more tree damage was seen. The tornado turned toward the east-northeast and likely remained on the ground east of CR228 (Doppler radar indicated a tornado debris signature). After approximately 1.3 miles the storm turned back to the east before it neared the Williamson/Bell County line about 0.15 miles west-northwest of CR231 in far northern Williamson County. A mobile home was shifted off its foundation at this location on the county line and multiple large oak trees were snapped and uprooted. This damage was also rated EF1. While in Williamson County this tornado had a maximum width of 500 yards and maximum winds of near 100 mph with a path length of 3.54 miles. This tornado began in northern Williamson County and additional information about the beginning of this tornado track can be found from the NWS Austin/San Antonio office.\nVideo evidence taken on the ground during the tornadic event, and areal footage of the damage track show the parent circulation produced at least 3 small, brief tornadoes while the storm circulation was near and east of the county line. Scattered damage points and small paths are making it difficult to determine which areas may have been impacted by each of these smaller tornadoes before the parent tornado formed. Therefore, in the area just east of the Williamson/Bell County line, the damage extent of the tornadic track has been widened to include all the known damage points (all EF-0s or EF-1s). In this case, since it is too difficult to discern the smaller tracks, and because they all formed from the same parent circulation within a short amount of time of each other, they will all be considered one tornado. The maximum width listed will remain the maximum width of the parent tornado (the EF-3 tornado).\nThe tornado, which began in northern Williamson County, entered extreme southern Bell County north of the junction between Bell County Road 231 and FM 2843. In this area there was a narrow swath of tree damage consistent with EF-0 intensity wind speeds, with some damage to outbuildings as well. The tornado moved east-northeast and intersected FM 2843, where the damage to trees and structures became much more significant. At least 15-20 damaged homes were visible to the survey team on both sides of FM 2843, with the most significant damage concentrated near the junction of FM 2843 and Buttermilk Road. In this vicinity, at least 10 structures suffered EF-2 to EF-3 intensity damage, with a small cluster of homes experiencing estimated peak tornado wind speeds of 150 to 165 mph. These structures had all or most of their roofs removed, and some of them had one or more exterior walls collapsed. Two churches along FM 2843 in the vicinity of Buttermilk Road were seriously damaged, with roofing material removed and multiple walls collapsed. Numerous vehicles in the area had significant damage consistent with being rolled or having flying projectiles thrown into them. Many hardwood trees along the FM 2843 corridor in the tornado path were uprooted or snapped, and many power poles were also snapped.\nBeyond Buttermilk Road, the tornado continued traveling east-northeastward another 1.5 miles along FM 2843, then began a sharp turn to the northeast and eventually a northerly direction. Aerial footage allowed us to track the damage through inaccessible areas where notable tree damage, damage to homes and barns was observed along the path of the tornado.\nThe tornado reached Crows Ranch Rd and damaged aluminum panels of the roof of a home and blew in the panel garage door. It continued over a ridge line, then intensified again shortly before crossing FM 2484. It uprooted many large trees, shifted a large barn's walls, lifted roof panels off a shed, and caused significant damage to a residence. The residence's roof was almost entirely removed from the structure, and a section of the south facing wall was blown in. The east facing wall was completely blown out, all consistent with a high-end EF2 rating in this location. The tornado then continued northwest into the South Shore neighborhood, and then into Union Grove Park where it lifted shortly after moving onto Stillhouse Hollow Lake.", "F_scale": 3.0, "Wind": 165.0, "Source": "NWS Storm Survey", "State_1": "TX", "State_2": null, "State_3": null, "SPC_id": 621315.0, "NCEI_id": "1021318, 1022969", "Tornado_type": "Tornado", "Storm_morphology": "Supercell" }, "geometry": { "type": "LineString", "coordinates": [ [ -97.788012111, 30.884611356 ], [ -97.783720577, 30.885421614 ], [ -97.777927006, 30.886231865 ], [ -97.774880016, 30.886452842 ], [ -97.769463359, 30.887741861 ], [ -97.759721576, 30.89179295 ], [ -97.751267254, 30.893339685 ], [ -97.745302021, 30.892897763 ], [ -97.737382734, 30.892308531 ], [ -97.732565487, 30.891682468 ], [ -97.730229412, 30.891795427 ], [ -97.701279964, 30.897948632 ], [ -97.693881426, 30.900121278 ], [ -97.687808905, 30.902772577 ], [ -97.684204016, 30.904429602 ], [ -97.6795648, 30.905515858 ], [ -97.669522609, 30.908130186 ], [ -97.657523077, 30.912751113 ], [ -97.64427967, 30.917242955 ], [ -97.635447826, 30.919580839 ], [ -97.631220665, 30.921476876 ], [ -97.627830352, 30.923998731 ], [ -97.625620212, 30.926078751 ], [ -97.623603191, 30.928729331 ], [ -97.622186985, 30.932705062 ], [ -97.6222299, 30.936680629 ], [ -97.622659053, 30.950078542 ], [ -97.624134939, 30.963474577 ], [ -97.625489455, 30.983247775 ], [ -97.623928409, 31.016722702 ] ] } },

It was determined that a brief EF-1 tornado that was embedded within a larger area of straight-line winds touched down 1.3 miles southeast of Upton, traveled east for just over 2.5 miles, and then lifted 3 miles east-southeast of Upton. The EF-1 tornado had a max wind of around 100 mph, and a max path width of around 200 yards.\nThe tornado touched down at solid EF-1 strength just northwest of the intersection of Weldon Loop Road and Watkins Alvey Road where a small barn was completely destroyed, and debris was scattered in many directions almost a half mile to the northeast. In addition, a small lean-to section of another barn was thrown back to the northwest, clear evidence of cyclonic rotation. Hardwood trees just downstream from the barn were also snapped and laying in a convergent pattern, offering more support for tornadic winds.\nThe tornado continued roughly eastward along Weldon Loop Road where it did some light damage to a barn roof and brought down large limbs from a hardwood tree. This damage occurred near the intersection of Johnson Road and Weldon Loop Road, and was in the EF-0 strength range. The tornado continued to the ENE along Weldon Loop Road at EF- 0 strength as it caused minor roof damage to a house, and damaged a greenhouse near the intersection of Wheeler and Wheldon Loop Roads. The tornado finished the last half mile of its path along Upton Talley Road where it uprooted or snapped softwood trees, damaged barns, and did minor fascia and shingle damage to a couple of homes. The tornado lifted about a quarter mile past the Upton Talley and Lanny Heath Roads intersection.\nIt should be noted that this brief tornado occurred within a larger area of straight-line wind damage where some older barns were destroyed and numerous softwood and hardwood trees were snapped or uprooted. However, the damage was mainly laying in an east-northeast direction consistent with overall storm motion and a straight-line wind signature. It was considered to make this damage part of the overall tornado, however the path width would have been over a half mile wide, which is unlikely for brief spin-up tornadoes embedded in a QLCS.\nIt should also be noted that more sporadic, and overall weaker, straight-line wind damage continued eastward along a consistent path across southern Larue county.

The tornado then destroyed a small shed constructed with cinder block walls, carrying contents from inside the shed toward the NNE. Large limbs from trees to the southeast of the shed were knocked down and facing the NW, towards the centerline of the tornado track. A second small shed behind property on the 300 block of Maple Shade Rd was destroyed, with debris carried over 200 yards toward the N and NE. The tornado intensified to EF-1 strength as it moved northeast and caused near complete destruction of a large barn on a property on Farmdale Rd. Three of the 4 barn walls were removed, as well as all of the roof, with debris carried more than 200 yards toward the NE. A second large barn was partially destroyed, with one wall completely removed, two walls partially removed, and half of the roof removed. There was one minor injury of scratches due to flying debris. Two large hardwood trees were downed on the property, pointing north toward the centerline of the tornado track. The tornado continued moving northeast, putting a dent into the southeast side of one large silo before causing crop damage in a large field. The pattern of crop damage was strongly convergent, with crops on the right periphery of the tornado track laying towards the WNW and crops on the left periphery of the tornado track laying towards the ESE. The tornado crossed over E Salem Rd near Ridge Rd, where it downed several large trees and snapped several others. Several more trees were uprooted farther north along Ridge Rd.

Wooden beams from one of the barns were carried by the tornado as projectiles that penetrated through the NW facing wall of another barn on the property. A house on the property was also damaged, with some siding dented, broken, or removed, and the partial collapse of a basement wall on the NW facing side of the house. The collapse of the basement wall caused minor cuts and scratches to at least two people taking shelter in the basement. The top of a farm silo was also removed. The tornado continued to produce significant damage as it hit another farm on Highland Rd. Two barns had their roofs completely removed. A third barn lost about half of its roof. A fourth structure, which appeared to be a shed without walls, collapsed. Two silos were also damaged, including the removal of the top of one of the silos.

The origin of this severe thunderstorm was the result of a cell merger of two separate thunderstorms that approached Saint Mary's County: one crossing eastward over the Potomac River from near Quantico in Virginia moving toward Charles County, Maryland; and the other one crossing northeast over the Potomac River near Colonial Beach. The cells merged over Charles County between La Plata and Dentsville, then proceeded due east toward northern Saint Mary's County where the tornado occurred.\nThe severe thunderstorm damaged over two dozen trees and large branches in an approximately three mile radius of the intersection of MD-5 Point Lookout Road and MD-235 Three Notch Road. Most of this damage was sporadic and isolated in areal extent, but included tree trunk snapps and uproots, with estimated wind speeds between 60 and 70 MPH based on the observed tree damage. However, there were two areas of more concentrated damage that helped lead to the determination of a tornado in this area of southern Maryland.\nThe tornado initially touched down around an enclave of residential houses 200 yards southwest of the intersection of MD-5 and MD-235. Here, there was a mix of about a dozen uprooted and trunk snaps of both hardwood and softwood trees. One of the trees fell onto the roof of a residence, causing roof damage; fortunately, there were no injuries despite a resident being inside the home when it fell. The trees fell to the north, east, southeast, east, west, and northwest. Due to the localized but prolific damage in this enclave, wind estimates are up to 85 MPH. It is believed that the tornado went right over this enclave of residences due to the random direction of tree falls.\nThe tornado may have lifted as it moved to the east-northeast. However, tornadic damage was noted about 3 miles further east along Delabrooke Road, where a chaotic mix of downed trees and branches were observed on both sides of the 40900 block in a deeply forested area. Residents in this area received the mobile phone alert before the damage occurred, and also reported half dollar size hail.\nFinally, a certified NWS SKYWARN Spotter filmed a video from MD-235, showing an earthward extension of the cloud base.

An aerial survey confirmed that the tornado damage was to tin metal roof panels that were peeled off of a plant on CR-1200. As the tornado continued northeast, near FM-411, a single family home had all of its walls removed with only the interior room left standing where a family of three sheltered where winds were estimated at 150 mph. After it crossed FM-411, it hit another single family home and collapsed all the walls, injuring a woman who left her vehicle to take shelter inside the home. The tornado continued on to CR-1275 where debarking of a few trees was first observed in addition to thousands of trees that were snapped and uprooted throughout the path of the tornado. It then crossed US-82, CR-2123, CR-2124, and FM-2283. At FM-2283, it destroyed a single family home along with several outbuildings. This area could not be surveyed at this location as debris removal had already begun. The tornado then continued to move along CR-2125 and CR-2030 before taking a more eastward jog across SH-37. At this point, it is estimated that it was about a third of a mile wide and it began to widen further as it demonstrated more widespread tree snaps and isolated debarking throughout the remainder of Red River County. After crossing SH-37, the tornado wiped a single family home off of its foundation north of Clarksville with large portions of the walls and roof carried several hundred yards northeast of the home. This damage was surrounded by widespread tree snaps with isolated debarking. This location was reviewed by a regional Quick Response Team (QRT) that determined the damage at this location was EF-4 with maximum winds of 170 mph. This was based on the construction of the home, the debris field spread 50-200 yards downstream from the home in small pieces, and the slab of the home being wiped clean. Ten people on the property of the home took shelter in an oil drain of a metal outbuilding that was completely destroyed with no injuries. The damage swath widened to approximately 0.6 miles northeast of Clarksville as it approached Acworth and continued to cross the Red River. Before it crossed the Red River, it collapsed all the walls on a single family home and completely destroyed Mount Olive Church. It then lifted a double-wide manufactured home off the ground near FM-1159 and threw it 50 yards with three dogs inside that all survived. The tornado then crossed the Red River into south-central McCurtain County, Oklahoma. This is the continuation of the Red River County Texas EF-4 tornado. This tornado had weakened upon entering Southern McCurtain County Oklahoma, producing EF-2 damage in rural areas southwest of Idabel, ripping the roofs off of several single family homes. Shortly before entering Idabel, the outer edge of this tornado hit the Oklahoma Mesonet observing platform located about 5 miles to the southwest off of Ravens Nest Road. An anemometer located 10 meters above the platform measured a wind gust of 108 mph, with a nearby single family home sustaining roof damage where EF-2 winds estimated near 125 mph removed a large section of the roof structure with a wall collapsing on another single family home off of Osprey Road. The tornado continued on to snap several hundred trees before hitting a single family home off of Boss Road which had a wall collapse and partial roof damage that could not be rated due to trees falling into the home. More EF-2 damage was observed as the tornado approached Highway 259 when the tornado removed the roof and much of the second story off of a single family home. The two people in the home took shelter on the first floor under the stairs, preventing injury as winds estimated at 125 mph damaged the home. As the tornado moved northeast across Stone Haven Road, a Davis weather station recorded a gust of approximately 130 mph.\nUpon entering Idabel, the tornado damaged additional roofs of homes in several neighborhoods on the southeast side of town. One of the most hard hit subdivisions was Country Club Estates. None of the homes in the Country Club Estates were rated due to tree damage which resulted in much of the structural damage from trees falling into homes. Nearby at the Idabel Country Club, nearly every tree sustained damage on approximately six holes, with mostly snaps observed. There was also some debarking of trees in this area, where an EF-3 swath of damage had begun. Behind the golf course, a single family home was destroyed with most of its walls collapsed except for a small interior room.\nThe tornado continued to move northeast, hitting the Kiamichi Family Medical Center where EF-2 damage (near 115 mph) was estimated due to the facade components that were torn from the structure. As the tornado approached Highway 259 and East Washington Street, it damaged the sign of a McDonald's and a swath of EF-3 winds completely destroyed the Donut Crossing and Express Tire stores. A sign from the Donut Crossing store was lofted by the tornado and carried 14.3 miles where it was found on the west side of Eagletown. After crossing East Washington Street, the tornado completely destroyed the Trinity Baptist Church. Winds at this location were estimated to be near 155 mph with the total destruction of the metal building system which was surrounded by a brick wall that collapsed with concrete anchors pulled up from the ground. The tornado moved on to produce narrow EF-2 damage in the more broader EF-1 damage swath with small vorticies likely extending down to the ground from the elevated large funnel cloud at this point.\nAfter moving northeast of Idabel, the tornado crossed mainly rural areas and completely destroyed chicken houses while snapping hardwood and softwood trees for approximately the next ten miles. An areal survey indicates that the tornado briefly lifted near the Little River and then touched down again in a forested area before damaging a metal structure atop a chicken plant off of Craig Road. A survey team from the National Weather Service Little Rock office found EF-2 damage with 135 mph winds between Eagletown and Broken Bow just south of Highway 70, where numerous trees and several wooden utility poles were snapped near the base near the Tyson Craig Feed Mill, a large elevator structure on top of a silo collapsed with a portion of a metal roof and walls ripped off of an adjacent metal building, and a doublewide manufactured home at the eastern end of Box Turtle Road was thrown off of its concrete pad, nearly pulling out an underground shelter, rolling over it, and landing about 30 feet to the north. Over half of the house was stripped of the undercarriage. Only about one-third of the walls/roof were left with the remainder of the structure removed and scattered well to the north.\nAs the tornado crossed Highway 70 just west of Eagletown, many additional pines and hardwoods were snapped and uprooted. Nearly all utility poles within the path were also snapped or pushed over. The tornado then moved into a heavily forested area north of Eagletown with more specific damage noted from Old Winship Road to Pero Creek through the use of high-resolution satellite imagery before the tornado finally lifted a few miles before reaching the border with Northwestern Sevier County in Southwest Arkansas.\nRemarkedly, only 6 injuries and no fatalities were reported from this long track tornado throughout Southern and Eastern McCurtain County Oklahoma. In total, 220 homes were estimated to had been affected by this tornado, with 10-20 businesses damaged or destroyed. Of the total homes affected, 65 of them were destroyed.", "F_scale": 4.0, "Wind": 170.0, "Source": "NWS Storm Survey", "State_1": "TX", "State_2": "OK", "State_3": null, "SPC_id": 621968.0, "NCEI_id": "1063274, 1060587", "Tornado_type": "Tornado", "Storm_morphology": "Supercell" }, "geometry": { "type": "LineString", "coordinates": [ [ -95.241790406, 33.504664099 ], [ -95.230975739, 33.525774419 ], [ -95.223079316, 33.535647987 ], [ -95.184032928, 33.576016941 ], [ -95.141804229, 33.623200687 ], [ -95.115368377, 33.645496742 ], [ -95.089286218, 33.676572907 ], [ -95.064216848, 33.687519735 ], [ -95.030224334, 33.704639047 ], [ -95.004264112, 33.72850364 ], [ -94.975939985, 33.752306734 ], [ -94.919473046, 33.799914681 ], [ -94.872437829, 33.838420995 ], [ -94.829865807, 33.865222558 ], [ -94.802781339, 33.880188776 ], [ -94.798884848, 33.887233929 ], [ -94.796953657, 33.888783628 ], [ -94.795108297, 33.889968149 ], [ -94.792462733, 33.891599118 ], [ -94.790338423, 33.893496063 ], [ -94.786414602, 33.89625472 ], [ -94.778076506, 33.900690734 ], [ -94.774857856, 33.902293618 ], [ -94.772626258, 33.903789615 ], [ -94.766770597, 33.90823697 ], [ -94.753423925, 33.920773169 ], [ -94.745742079, 33.926613268 ], [ -94.740549322, 33.9301385 ], [ -94.730481808, 33.935998901 ], [ -94.723100369, 33.939488141 ], [ -94.713830655, 33.944543724 ], [ -94.70576257, 33.949314211 ], [ -94.695377057, 33.956789809 ], [ -94.68584985, 33.965047801 ], [ -94.679955768, 33.974297504 ], [ -94.674393035, 33.984214228 ], [ -94.669913578, 33.992090239 ], [ -94.665981627, 33.996454601 ], [ -94.65244286, 34.006289923 ], [ -94.636950421, 34.021159304 ], [ -94.63220567, 34.02475199 ], [ -94.625528029, 34.029588742 ], [ -94.585960081, 34.057610148 ], [ -94.559764569, 34.072826383 ], [ -94.541654294, 34.089887657 ], [ -94.533328717, 34.094649982 ], [ -94.529208844, 34.096497976 ], [ -94.520110791, 34.107656162 ], [ -94.507837002, 34.126344602 ] ] } },

This tornado was determined to be the strongest one produced by this particular thunderstorm and generated a few spots of low end EF-3 damage in several locations along its nearly 16-mile long path, with estimated maximum winds near 140 mph. This tornado first touched down along U.S. Highway 67 to the southwest of Simms and quickly grew in strength and width after tracking a few miles, briefing reaching a width of nearly a half mile at times. Just west of Simms and continuing northeast just past FM-561, the tornado produced many instances of EF-2 damage to both trees and structures. As the tornado crossed FM-561, there were several structures, a few well built, which had roofs and many walls removed, with 140 mph winds estimated here which were just inside the EF-3 threshold. Additionally, near this structural damage, there was a small section of asphalt road removed from FM-561 and the road debris was thrown into one residence. From there, the tornado then tracked northeast nearly four miles through very rural and uninhabited areas west of Texas Highway 98. The tornado finally moved back over Highway 98 and produced another area of considerable damage at the intersection of Highway 98 and CR-1840. In this area, several structures were largely destroyed, including a few small retail buildings, and this again garnered some high end EF-2 and low end EF-3 ratings with no injuries. After this point, the tornado travelled its final seven miles by crossing the southwestern, then western, and then northern portions of the city of New Boston, before ending just west of Highway 8 north of Interstate 30.

The most intense damage of the tornado occurred here as two residences were essentially destroyed. One residence was a one or two family residence which had its roof and most of its walls removed, with many interior walls collapsed. One injury occurred at this home, but fortunately, was not significant. A nearby single-wide mobile home was also destroyed from this tornado. In addition, many barns and/or outbuildings were destroyed in this general location and at least several livestock were killed. The peak 140 mph EF-3 rating of this tornado occurred here as well, due to observed tree debarking near the one or two family residence. Significant ground scouring near where the livestock were killed was also observed. This ground scouring is usually a trait associated with very intense tornado vorticies, but it is not an official damage indicator used to rate tornadoes.\nFrom this location, the tornado continued roughly 3.5 miles east-northeast before crossing Wyant Road and the Twelve Mile Post Road intersection. The survey team did not have access in the 3.5 mile span before this intersection, but used available drone footage to confirm significant swaths of tree damage in this gap. Only tree damage was observed along Wyant Road, but the high level of tree snapping was enough to confirm EF-2 strength here. From here, the tornado continued along Wyant Road, which had turned northeast to criss-cross the tornado's path through the hillier terrain. The tornado damage showed a tendency for the tornado to narrow and weaken at times through the terrain, but it did continue without lifting until reaching the Ouachita River. Along the southwestern bank of the river, there were two homes that received significant damage and several outbuildings were totally destroyed with debris thrown into the river.

The tornado then briefly moved back over the lake before crossing Highway 2 where several single family homes were heavily damaged and at least a few shops and outbuildings destroyed. The most heavily damaged structure, warranting a 130 mph wind speed estimate, was a two story home which had its roof and much of the second story removed or destroyed. Two injuries occurred within this home, although both were non-critical. The tornado then tracked over a small portion of the lake again before coming ashore and moving across Corney Creek Drive and Dozier Road. In this area, there were several residences damaged by falling trees, although one cabin was largely destroyed due to a combination of falling trees and wind forcing. The tornado then tracked over a nearly 2 mile span where the survey team had no access, although a tornado debris signature on radar gave confidence that the circulation remained on the ground. The tornado had grown to a width of approximately 500 yards by the time it next crossed Denton Road, where many EF-2 damage indicators were found and four single family homes were heavily damaged or destroyed. One double-wide mobile home here was thrown and completely destroyed, with 5 injuries reported. A single-wide mobile home was also thrown and destroyed, although no injuries were known to the survey team at this location. Two one or two family homes in this location also suffered damage to roofs and some walls. Additionally, extreme tree damage with at least a few trees exhibiting some debarking were found in this area as well. Significant tree damage continued to the northeast as the tornado crossed Highway 15 and moved across Camp Road. The most significant damage associated with this tornado occurred in the Camp Road area as the 400-500 yard wide tornado struck an apartment complex and an adjacent mobile home park. Here, seven of the nine single-wide mobile homes were thrown or completely destroyed. It is estimated that the strongest core of the tornadic winds only clipped the south end of the apartment complex, but one building in this area had a large portion of its roof and some exterior walls removed. This damage warranted the peak 140 mph EF-3 rating of the tornado with widespread mid to strong EF-2 damage occurring throughout this area. According to Louisiana Governor John Bel Edwards, of the 74 units at this housing complex, only 12 of them were habitable following this tornado. The survey team received a confirmation of 14 total injuries, two of which were critical, from this tornado. However, details of which injuries occurred in associated to the various damaged structures along Camp Road were not known. Afterwards, the tornado moved through a nearly 2 mile long heavily forested area inaccessible to the survey team,  although the team did confirm strong EF-2 level tree damage did continue well into this forested area east of Camp Road.
