Here, it caused significant damage to a well constructed two-story home shifting it off its foundation, and significantly damaging eight chicken houses, two of which were destroyed. The tornadic storm continued northeast where it crossed County Road 4230 and significantly damaged the Dekalb Water Treatment Plant, before crossing the intersection of Farm to Market Road 990 and Farm to Market Road 1840 where a one-story home had its roof removed and several hardwood and softwood trees were snapped or uprooted. As the tornado tracked across County Road 4228, there were signs of it widening where the snapped hardwood trees and downed power lines were more noticeable. Once the tornado tracked across Highway 82, hardwood trees snapped at its base and significant damage to roofs of a church and nearby one and two-story homes were prevalent. The tornadic storm continued to move northeast across County Road 3201 where numerous hardwood trees were downed and a camper was destroyed. The tornado continued northeast where it crossed County Road 3203, uplifting a metal roof from a home and destroyed seven chicken farm buildings. Once it crossed northeast across County Road 3202, it split and twisted hardwood trees and destroyed an outbuilding before finally dissipating.\nIn all, 16 single family homes were damaged, 9 suffering minor damage, and 7 with major damage, with 32 mobile homes damaged, 25 suffering minor damage, 4 with major damage, and 3 mobile homes destroyed. The Dekalb Water Treatment Plant suffered about $500,000 in damage, with another $500,000 damage done to the chicken houses that were destroyed, as well to an auto repair shop and a gun shop that were significantly damaged.

The tornado then destroyed the roof of a barn on Hugh Gill Road before hitting a home on McGhee Road, causing significant roof and chimney damage. Maximum winds in Tennessee were estimated to be 95 mph. The tornado then moved into Kentucky where it intensified to EF-2 and traveled for another 11.3 miles. Please refer to NWS Louisville and Kentucky Storm Data for more information on the Kentucky portion of the path. The Tennessee portion of the path was updated and extended southwestward in June 2020 based on newly available high resolution Google Earth satellite imagery. The National Weather Service conducted a storm damage survey in Logan county Kentucky. The damage moved in from Robertson County Tennessee near the end of McGee Road where two homes received extensive damage. The first home, a well built stone home had significant roof damage and the screened in porch was destroyed. The family pick up truck was tossed around 40 yards to the north. On the family cemetery plot several tombstones were knocked over and one headstone was destroyed. There were several outbuildings and 2 pole Barnes were destroyed on the property as well.\nThe second home experienced significant foundation damage and the roof was completely thrown off. The family pick up truck was thrown 250 yards and thrown down into a field. Insulation from the home was thrown down wind over 300 yards. The debris field from the two homes was thrown in a farmers field between 100 yards in a quarter mile down wind with several 2 x 4 and 2 x 10 and bricks being impaled into the ground. Winds were estimated between 120 and 130 mph.\nThe tornado then moved through several farmers fields doing extensive tree damage and fence damage. Power lines were down throughout this entire stretch. The tornado then hit 901 Dot Road destroying 2 barns, moving heavy farm equipment, blowing out exterior walls and destroying the roof at the property. Tragically, a woman in the home was killed by falling debris. The family pet dog was found alive by rescuers underneath extensive rubble. Debris was thrown up to 500 yards and debris with a width of between 250 and and 300 yards in a farmers field. Winds were estimated to be 135 mph at this location.\nNext, the tornado hit a large family farm at 3604 Schley Road destroying the second story. Three farm silos that were empty or destroyed with the metal sheets being thrown over a quarter mile down wind. The tornado continued through farm fields destroying several trees and uprooting them.\nThe tornado became more elevated at the intersection of Mortimor Station Road and Mirriaheh Road. In this area trees we snapped, and several homes experienced shingle siding and roof damage. Winds were estimated to be 100 to 110 mph here.\nAs the tornado was lifting, it snapped some trees in the Schochoh community.", "F_scale": 2, "Wind": 135, "Source": "NWS Storm Survey", "State_1": "TN", "State_2": "KY", "State_3": null }, "geometry": { "type": "LineString", "coordinates": [ [ -87.020729195, 36.631529338 ], [ -87.013831081, 36.63773249 ], [ -87.009272101, 36.641240646 ], [ -87.00487734, 36.644066734 ], [ -86.993184265689251, 36.649276152992549 ], [ -86.948166070048956, 36.668215262744503 ], [ -86.908394274776128, 36.681690578389841 ], [ -86.870736060207037, 36.7009959044344 ], [ -86.822293219630865, 36.719319446984606 ], [ -86.817575392787603, 36.721083107445317 ] ] } },

Damage at this point consisted of snapped trees and was consistent with 90 mph wind speeds, or EF-1 on the Enhanced Fujita Scale. The tornado remained on the ground as it traveled north toward Peeler Elementary School. Numerous homes in this area were damaged along with substantial tree damage. The tornado wind speeds at this location were estimated to be approximately 100 mph. The tornado continued traveling north and reached a peak intensity and maximum path width in the Hampton Community and near Hampton Elementary School. At this school a large portion of the roof was blown off and three adjacent portable classroom buildings (manufactured buildings) were completely destroyed and leveled. The damage to the main school building was consistent with wind speeds around 110 mph (DI 15/DOD 6), while the damage to the adjacent portable units was consistent with wind speeds of 135 mph (DI 4/DOD 12), which is a high-end EF2 on the Enhanced Fujita Scale. It s worth noting that the neighborhoods adjacent to this school experienced a wide and substantial path of devastation which included snapped and uprooted trees, snapped power poles, homes that were pushed off of their foundation, numerous homes that lost most or all of their roof cover, and several homes with exterior walls blown out. The survey found the width of the tornado, and particularly the width of the EF1 and EF2 wind speeds, contributed to a particularly wide path of destruction. The tornado then continued north-northeast and mostly remained on the ground all the way to the Guilford/Rockingham County line. Along the way, the damage consisted mostly of snapped and uprooted trees, and roof and siding damage to several additional homes. The tornado appeared to produce minor tree damage (with wind speeds 80 mph or less) just before crossing into Rockingham County. Finally, the aforementioned path length (16 miles) consists of just the Guilford County path. The tornado continued into Rockingham County, and remained on the ground for an additional 17.6 miles. A tornado touched down southeast of Greensboro in Guilford County shortly after 4:00 PM EST. This tornado later entered Rockingham County about one mile southeast of Haw River near Chrismon Road at 4:25 PM EST. The tornado damaged numerous buildings, outbuildings, and barns. At least twenty homes and farms suffered damage, while one house and two mobile homes were completely destroyed. The Oak Haven Event Center in downtown Ruffin also sustained damage. Countless trees were snapped or uprooted. Estimated maximum wind speeds were 110 MPH. Seven people were injured, including a father and a seven-year-old son who were critically injured in their moving car when it struck a double-wide mobile home that was lifted on to the 1300 block of Grooms Road.

The tornado began in a wooded area just east of the County Road 80 bridge over Rock Creek. The tornado crossed County 80 where a tree was uprooted. County Road 80 criss-crossed the tornado's path a couple times as it moved eastward. Sporadic tree damage occurred with several large branches broken and a few trees uprooted or snapped. The roof was removed from a newer large shed, and tin was peeled back from a couple of old barns. The tornado crossed into Cullman County just south of County Road 1063. As the tornado crossed from Winston into Cullman County, the tornado likely lifted shortly after crossing CR 1069 and producing minor limb damage. The tornado likely touched down again west of the CR 1055 and CR 1082 intersection. Extensive tree damage was observed. Numerous trees were either uprooted or snapped as the tornado tracked through a depression on the north side of CR 1055. Intensity was documented as 90 mph (EF-1) as it approached CR 1082. At this point, the tornado likely lifted again as it moved east of CR 1082 with only minor limb damage observed through Sullivan Creek.\nPeak intensity of the tornado was observed along CR 1091, west of CR 1114. A one year old manufactured home was completely destroyed as it broke away from its anchors, causing 3 injuries. The home was perpendicular to the winds, facing due west. It was displaced about 20 yards from its original location. Three of four corner anchor units were ripped from the ground. The fourth remained lodged in ground but the metal strap was ripped from the I-Beam. It is worth noting that the anchors were approximately 2-3 feet into the ground, and were strapped to the I-Beam (from what could be observed). However, given the highly saturated, muddy soil, the anchors were pulled out as the home tipped backwards. Given this potential failure, winds were estimated at 130 mph (EF-2), or slightly above the expected value for a completely destroyed manufactured home. Additionally, near this location, several trees were uprooted. Peak width of approximately 180 yards were also documented in this area.\nAs the tornado tracked east, another area of downed branches and uprooted trees were noted east of CR 1107. This was the final location of observed damage as the tornado likely lifted and eventually dissipated along CR 1114.", "F_scale": 2, "Wind": 130, "Source": "NWS Storm Survey", "State_1": "AL", "State_2": null, "State_3": null }, "geometry": { "type": "LineString", "coordinates": [ [ -87.134409651, 34.241454121 ], [ -87.133374318, 34.241764544 ], [ -87.123582753, 34.246092314 ], [ -87.122977647, 34.246352168 ], [ -87.117892179, 34.247256774 ], [ -87.113665017, 34.247926353 ], [ -87.112592133, 34.248103724 ], [ -87.110316627, 34.248208221 ], [ -87.11013392, 34.24821816 ], [ -87.102537904, 34.246373485 ], [ -87.06560925, 34.247916629 ], [ -87.062176022, 34.247845681 ], [ -87.045954022, 34.249335588 ], [ -87.026097003, 34.25056027 ], [ -87.023251805, 34.249814481 ], [ -87.015518536, 34.249992538 ], [ -87.013595853, 34.249974111 ] ] } },

This tornado, with estimated maximum winds of 134 mph, continued northeast across the heavily wooded areas just southeast of Highway 8, until it crossed Cecil Road where a double wide mobile home on cinder blocks was lifted, flipped, and moved approximately 100 yards. Fortunately, the couple living in the mobile home received the Tornado Warning via Wireless Emergency Alerts and moved to a nearby home before the mobile home was destroyed. The tornado tracked northeast across Highway 774 where numerous trees were snapped or uprooted, before moving over Mayo Road. It was here where a mobile home was completely destroyed with five other mobile homes, three structures, and four family homes suffering partial damage. The tornado crossed Highway 8 and along Highway 772, where the roof of a mobile home was partially ripped off, and a resident was trapped in a nearby home by falling trees. The tornado then moved through the community of Trout, where additional trees were snapped or uprooted and power lines downed along Highway 84 and Church Street. It continued northeast across Biltmore Drive, and across a heavily wooded area before finally lifting near an unnamed dirt road just off of Highway 127 a couple of miles northwest of Jena. The total path length of this tornado from when it initially touched down just southwest of Alexandria (in Rapides Parish), to when it lifted northwest of Jena (in La Salle Parish) was approximately 38 miles.\nThe La Salle Parish Office of Homeland Security and Emergency Preparedness estimates that 82 homes were damaged, eleven mobile homes were destroyed, as well as damage to two business and one public building. The Trout Post Office received minor damage as well as Ganey Equipment and a Methodist Church.", "F_scale": 2, "Wind": 135, "Source": "NWS Storm Survey", "State_1": "LA", "State_2": null, "State_3": null }, "geometry": { "type": "LineString", "coordinates": [ [ -92.478564859, 31.246908907 ], [ -92.47438062, 31.249384205 ], [ -92.470759714, 31.251718577 ], [ -92.467396522, 31.255162941 ], [ -92.463848429, 31.263831273 ], [ -92.462726642, 31.270387655 ], [ -92.461178342, 31.271621429 ], [ -92.456729875, 31.27588145 ], [ -92.455127994, 31.278365317 ], [ -92.454234695, 31.280214576 ], [ -92.452690305, 31.282256413 ], [ -92.449618074, 31.286436411 ], [ -92.441108035, 31.301119553 ], [ -92.423428751, 31.328921328 ], [ -92.423085806, 31.332477364 ], [ -92.416948348, 31.340236797 ], [ -92.403791828, 31.357230242 ], [ -92.395420538, 31.365325546 ], [ -92.392583229, 31.374467298 ], [ -92.390115864, 31.381300844 ], [ -92.387393292, 31.384724608 ], [ -92.385033211, 31.386950496 ], [ -92.384473026, 31.388344827 ], [ -92.384977245, 31.389782696 ], [ -92.385309481, 31.39110164 ], [ -92.385112103, 31.393508563 ], [ -92.366077963, 31.413264481 ], [ -92.364886181, 31.417070396 ], [ -92.35913563, 31.423148745 ], [ -92.358047214, 31.426065065 ], [ -92.35350077, 31.432353735 ], [ -92.348838286, 31.441132832 ], [ -92.34825343, 31.445851139 ], [ -92.344729392954974, 31.452336984428253 ], [ -92.341598420802399, 31.456828656348076 ], [ -92.336816764369502, 31.463039430531349 ], [ -92.330733491971984, 31.47415620342144 ], [ -92.328033155694499, 31.479389431628075 ], [ -92.320987357690825, 31.487944659518686 ], [ -92.21266548980762, 31.64149007268497 ], [ -92.205327733352675, 31.651945979076114 ], [ -92.197152047350897, 31.662707046347347 ], [ -92.194674744203581, 31.66652210124084 ], [ -92.181838161244883, 31.686912723558631 ], [ -92.181422545507445, 31.687830076294627 ], [ -92.181173323586478, 31.68876461006948 ], [ -92.180508173003687, 31.690689132290569 ], [ -92.179496831193461, 31.692571931260314 ], [ -92.178023821607127, 31.694432609456268 ], [ -92.17741750825931, 31.695295155721393 ], [ -92.177384844913973, 31.696818941014495 ], [ -92.177642404034628, 31.698593490498748 ], [ -92.177962309613719, 31.700092860239234 ], [ -92.177957302823557, 31.701138042586532 ], [ -92.177668428912654, 31.701626443045821 ], [ -92.176807551577582, 31.702511348503318 ], [ -92.173980324461951, 31.704081573265281 ], [ -92.165386407568946, 31.712099396365371 ], [ -92.157581894591345, 31.720854186194625 ] ] } },

Numerous trees were downed in the Pheasant Ridge community just south of MD-144/Frederick Road, and several mobile homes were heavily damaged. Several power poles were snapped along MD-144/Frederick Road.\nAs the tornado crossed Interstate 70/US-40/Baltimore National Pike, numerous trees and branches were downed in the roadway and on vehicles, which appeared to have been pulled off the roadway by the winds. No injuries were reported.\nThe tornado proceeded to move into the retail area of Mt. Airy, where a canopy over the gas pumps at High's Dairy Store was partially torn off, and the TJ Maxx roof was lifted up and partially removed. There were also numerous trees snapped and uprooted in a convergent manner behind the shopping center to near the Mt. Airy water tower. In the immediate path, virtually no trees were left undamaged, indicative of winds over 100 MPH.\nThe tornado continued northward from this point, where several outbuildings at the Knills Farm Market just east of MD-27/Ridge Road were severely damaged or completely destroyed, including a metal silo which twisted and collapsed. Nearby along Watersville Road, several more power poles were snapped purely from wind (not from trees falling on power lines). On either side of the farm, virtually all trees in the tornado's path were downed in a convergent manner, including at a residence along Watersville Road, with some showing signs of bark being stripped by the wind. This was one area where maximum winds are estimated to have been near 120 mph.\nThe tornado continued northeastward, with several residences experiencing shingle and roof damage/removal along Arrowwood Circle, and downed numerous trees and power lines, consistent with winds around 90 MPH.\nNumerous hardwood trees, virtually all in the tornado's path, were snapped with signs of stripped bark along the 6000 block of Runkles Road. At Snell's Greenhouses, water was completely removed from a pond, and several greenhouses were destroyed. A nearby home weather station in the tornado's path just to the northeast measured a wind gust of 112 mph. Based on this, it is likely the tornado's maximum winds again approached 120 mph in this area. This occurred at around 825 PM EDT, when the FAA's Terminal Doppler Weather Radar near Washington Dulles International Airport showed it's strongest rotational signature.\nThe last evidence of tornadic damage was observed on Gillis Falls Road where a few trees were uprooted in convergent fashion just east of Runkles Road.

The tornado then crossed the road into Rutherford County, where a small but well-built brick home had its roof blown off and brick walls blown in. One wall fell onto the homeowner causing minor injuries. Further to the northeast on Williams Road, one barn was heavily damaged and another completely destroyed. The narrow but strong EF-2 tornado continued northeast, carving a well-defined path through forests before striking a new 3000 square foot home on the west side of Midland Crescent Road. This large house, which was poorly attached to its cinder-block foundation, was lifted almost completely intact, flipped upside down, and rotated 90 degrees as it was blown to the north-northwest. One woman inside the home was killed. Numerous trees continued to be blown down further to the northeast across Jones Road. Upon reaching Rock Springs Midland Road, another home that was built in the 1800s took a direct hit from the tornado, losing its roof and all of the third story. The homeowners inside received the warning and took appropriate shelter on the lowest floor, escaping uninjured. Two silos and a barn just north of the home were de-roofed, and several nearby trees were blown down. Curving more to the east-northeast, two 70 foot-tall silos and two sheet metal barns located northwest of Rock Springs Midland Road at Gray Fox Drive were completely destroyed. Another smaller barn was destroyed and adjacent home received roof damage north of Eagle Creek Road. As the tornado crossed a northward bend in Rock Springs Road, a detached garage was completely destroyed while a home suffered minor roof damage. Further to the east, an outbuilding and mobile home were heavily damaged, with debris being blown up to 200 yards to the east. The tornado continued east-northeast, causing minor exterior damage to a home and damaging the roof of a barn.

The tornado finally weakened to EF-1 as it crossed Rock Springs Midland Road yet again, overturning an old, small mobile home on the north side of the road just west of Highway 231. Two women inside the mobile home were injured. The tornado weakened further as it continued east of Highway 231 where part of the roof of a barn was blown off and several trees were blown down. A few more trees and outbuildings were damaged along Highway 269 and Christiana Lowe Road before the tornado lifted just east of Woodfin Road.

This major EF-2 tornado, which began in Franklin County near Tims Ford Lake, weakened considerably to EF-0 as it entered the extreme southeastern portion of Coffee County, with just a few trees blown down along Rutledge Hill Road. The worst damage was along Coker Road where a barn was destroyed, another barn suffered roof damage, and the front porch of a home was ripped off causing minor roof damage. After taking a sharp bend to the east, the tornado caused severe damage to an outbuilding on Boyd Road. Several outbuildings were destroyed and a house sustained roof damage when its front porch was ripped off. Numerous more trees were blown down further to the east on Rutledge Hill Road and along and onto I-24, which caused a multi-vehicle accident at mile marker 126. Another barn suffered roof damage on Sims Lane before the tornado moved into Grundy County. The tornado then intensified rapidly to EF-2 in extreme southwest Grundy County, with a nearly-finished brand new home almost completely destroyed on Conry Circle. Two nearby homes suffered significant roof and siding damage, and a barn lost nearly all of its roof. Debris from all of these buildings was blown up to 500 yards to the east and northeast. Further to the east, a mobile home on Frank Wilson Road was knocked off its piers into a garage. The tornado the tracked up and down a nearly 1600 foot tall ridge before reaching Homer White Road, heavily damaging two barns and destroying an outbuilding. Curving more to the northeast, the tornado ripped off the roof of a brick home on Highway 50. Luckily, the house occupants were taking shelter and were not injured. Two adjacent outbuildings were severely damaged, and other nearby homes and barns suffered minor damage. Debris from these buildings was blown up to 500 yards to the northeast. The tornado continued to cause a wide swath of wind damage to trees and buildings along Highway 50 before crossing Schoolhouse Hollow and Nunley Hollow and climbing nearly 1000 feet in elevation onto the Cumberland Plateau.
