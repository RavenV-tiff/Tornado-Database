The tornado damage began in a wooded area just southwest of the intersection of Alexandria Road and Saks Road where minor timber damage was observed. Damage was largely confined to timber damage until it entered a residential area just north of Finks Lake. The tornado caused notable roof damage on the west and south sides of a home near the north edge of the lake while a residence immediately to the east suffered the loss of a few shingles. A softwood tree was uprooted to the west of the residence that suffered the most roof damage as well. The tornado continued further southeast across Finks Lake where a few softwood trees were uprooted on both the north and south sides of the lake. A small boat dock on the southeast side of the lake suffered peel back of a portion of its roof, and a camper was flipped over just off of Cane Creek Road. The camper did not appear to have an awning or canopy extended and other than having stabilizers deployed had no anchoring. The tornado continued southeast across Cane Creek Road where a softwood tree was uprooted and a horse trailer was blown onto its side in an open field further southeast. The tornado then lifted in this field.", "F_scale": 0, "Wind": 65, "Source": "NWS Storm Survey", "State_1": "AL", "State_2": null, "State_3": null }, "geometry": { "type": "LineString", "coordinates": [ [ -85.846444085, 33.750233265 ], [ -85.845575049, 33.7493122 ], [ -85.844512894, 33.747333996 ], [ -85.843754986, 33.746295172 ], [ -85.842694356, 33.745473952 ], [ -85.841514184, 33.744617515 ], [ -85.838880256, 33.742877851 ], [ -85.837233379, 33.742190898 ], [ -85.836358979, 33.741769355 ] ] } },

The tornado was believed to have touched down around 1:15pm MDT on June 21, 2018, approximately 5 miles northwest of Darlington, Idaho. The assessment team found several large hardwood tree limbs down along Huston Road. The largest diameter limb was 1 foot in diameter. About 1.5 miles down Huston Road from Highway 93, a residence on the south side of the road experienced extensive tree damage as well, including a hardwood tree split near the trunk. A second tree was completely uprooted although the root system appeared to be somewhat shallow, perhaps only a couple of feet deep. A third tree was nearly uprooted. A camper was overturned and a large section of the metal roofing had been peeled back. Some of the trusses off of a garage with a metal roof were ripped off. Video of the tornado showed it traveling to the north of Leslie Butte, although it is not clear if it was still on the ground at this point.\nA second video shows the tornado on the ground approximately 1 mile northeast of Darlington around 1:32pm. The video shows the tornado on the ground for at least 3 minutes while east of Darlington. The damage team found a 40 to 50 foot section of barbed wire fencing down along with several metal fencing posts bent over or ripped out of the ground about 1.5 miles east of Darlington. The tornado lifted around 1:38pm MDT. The National Weather Service received reports of wheel lines, a chicken coop, pig pen, a shed destroyed, and a screen door ripped off. However, the damage assessment team was unable to find this damage.\nBased on the damage, the final assessment for this tornado is a high-end EF0 with winds of 75 to 85 mph.

The landspout tornado crossed U.S. 64 very near Elk Lane Rd. tracking slightly north of due east until dissipating over the northeast portion of Eagle Nest Lake. Elevations along the track ranged from approximately 8350 feet to 8175 feet. Approximately 180 feet of barbed wire/picket fence was downed and damaged. Several steel t-posts were sheared or bent nearly 90-degrees. All 10 units that comprise the Pepper Sauce Camp property suffered damage. All but two of sixteen west-facing windows were partially or completely destroyed by flying debris. Windows and storm doors at the main building were partially or completely busted. A small car that was parked and facing east had all but the front windshield busted out. The bed of an old truck used as a marketing sign was lifted and carried about 50 feet toward the southwest. The front windshield of an old Chevrolet C65 truck was struck no less than 75 times by flying debris but remained intact while both side windows were completely busted out. An old hay barn was collapsed and roofing material found 300 feet away. An unoccupied fifth wheel recreational vehicle with an estimated weight of 12,000 pounds was partially lifted, shifted and rolled on its side at the Eagle Nest Campground.

The tornado touched down in an inaccessible area approximately one-third of a mile north of the intersection of Highway 82 and County Road 37. At this intersection, storm chaser video shows what appears to be a funnel cloud with rising motion just west of Highway 82. Seconds later, rear-flank downdraft (RFD) winds are also evident as the storm chaser relocates to the south. This matches up well with radar data from KBMX, and a tornado debris signature (TDS) is noted downstream approximately two minutes after the video ended. This TDS was also observed from KMXX radar. Around the time of the initial TDS from KBMX, a second video from the same storm chaser was taken one-half mile south of the first video, showing an occluding circulation and RFD clear slot.", "F_scale": 0, "Wind": 65, "Source": "NWS Storm Survey", "State_1": "AL", "State_2": null, "State_3": null }, "geometry": { "type": "LineString", "coordinates": [ [ -86.7415, 32.6326 ], [ -86.7371, 32.6326 ] ] } },
