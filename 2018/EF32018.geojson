The tornado first touched down west of US Highway 431 north of town of Wellington, where it rapidly intensified and widened. It snapped and uprooted numerous trees along US Highway 431. Several homes were damaged by the falling trees. The tornado proceeded eastward across Websters Road and Broughton Road with scattered tree damage. As the tornado crossed Old Sulphur Springs Road, two homes were damaged with scores of trees snapped or uprooted. At Angel Station Road, the tornado filled the valley from one side to the other and caused extensive tree and home damage. An electrical transmission tower line was toppled at this point, but it was believed that flying debris compromised the structure. The tornado continued eastward and destroyed the sanctuary at West Point Baptist Church. Additional structures were severely damaged at the church. The tornado entered the City of Jacksonville where it gained strength into the EF3 category, with winds around 140 mph. It removed most of the roof and the top floor of two buildings in an apartment complex. The tornado affected the entire campus of Jacksonville State University. Several buildings sustained significant damage. The most intense winds remained north of the campus however, mowing down trees and causing direct damage to homes. As the tornado crossed Highway 21, it caused caused major damage to the Merrill Building. It then moved into a highly populated zone, where scores of homes suffered major damage and rendered uninhabitable. The tornado maintained its strength as it crossed Choccolocco Mountain, and winds funneled up the valley uprooting or snapping trees. It caused major damage to a number of homes on the mountainside. Damaged continued all the way up to just south of the peak of the mountain. As the tornado moved down the eastern side of Choccolocco Mountain, it narrowed substantially and became stronger once it reached the valley below. Stands of trees were wiped out with trunks snapped relatively close to ground level. Perhaps the most intense damage along the entire track occurred along Hollingsworth Road, where a site built home was completely destroyed with only a portion of one interior wall left standing. Debris from this home was blown downstream across a field with some evidence of wind rowing. Hay bales adjacent to the home, estimated at 800 pounds each, were thrown up to 300 yards to the east. Maximum winds at this location were estimated at 150 mph. The tornado continued east-southeast and downed thousands of trees in the Talladega National Forest and crossed into Cleburne County just south of County Road 534. National Weather Service meteorologists surveyed damage in northern Cleburne County and determined that the damage was consistent with an EF1 tornado, with maximum sustained winds near 100 mph. This tornado began in Calhoun County just west of Highway 431 and crossed into Cleburne County just south of County Road 534. The tornado continued east-southeast across a very rural portion of the county where it snapped or uprooted hundreds of softwood trees. The tornado crossed into the state of Georgia near County Road 57. A National Weather Service survey team found that the tornado that struck Jacksonville, AL moved into Georgia as an EF1 with a maximum wind speed of 95 mph and a maximum path width of 400 yards. The tornado entered Georgia northwest of Tallapoosa along Broad Street, snapping and uprooting trees along the road as it moved east for about a mile before ending on Edgar Little Circle between Broad Street and Womack Road. A large Oak tree fell on a home about 1/4 of a mile east of the state line resulting in extensive damage.

It would continue into the western portion of the independent city of Lynchburg and further northward into Amherst County. This is the second segment of a tornado that touched down just south of Waterlink Road near Timberlake in Campbell County at 6:00 PM EST. The tornado crossed Timberlake Road and entered the independent city of Lynchburg at 6:03 PM EST. The tornado uprooted trees and caused notable damage to 332 private buildings, and 34 of those buildings were condemned due to the damage. It also damaged numerous power lines and transformers. Two people were injured. At 6:07 PM EST, the tornado left the independent city of Lynchburg, crossed the James River, and continued northward into Amherst County. This is the third and final segment of a tornado that touched down just south of Waterlink Road near Timberlake in Campbell County at 6:00 PM EST. The tornado crossed through the independent city of Lynchburg and eventually tracked over the James River into Amherst County at 6:08 PM EST. This was only the third EF3 tornado to occur in the NWS Blacksburg forecast since 1950, and was the longest track tornado within the state of Virginia for the NWS Blacksburg forecast area. The tornado reached its peak intensity with estimated maximum winds of 150 MPH as it crossed Route 130 and entered the town of Elon. A total of 166 homes suffered damage, and 22 of those homes were considered a total loss. A motor home was carried about thirty feet and tipped over. The hardest hit locations were along Nottaway Drive and Deerfield Drive. Seven people were injured and taken to the hospital from Elon. As the tornado continued north-northeastward out of Elon, it snapped or uprooted hundreds of trees and caused more minor roof damage to homes.

The tornado did encounter one farmstead producing EF2 damage to the structures onsite before remaining in agricultural fields for the rest of its path.", "F_scale": 3, "Wind": 145, "Source": "NWS Storm Survey", "State_1": "IA", "State_2": null, "State_3": null }, "geometry": { "type": "LineString", "coordinates": [ [ -92.93706898, 41.460169872 ], [ -92.935630625, 41.459006134 ], [ -92.934375658, 41.457939103 ], [ -92.932806176, 41.457015685 ], [ -92.932045909, 41.456719513 ], [ -92.931175058, 41.456439064 ], [ -92.929602026, 41.455964129 ], [ -92.927918136, 41.455549255 ], [ -92.926261924, 41.454947109 ], [ -92.925062346, 41.454269016 ], [ -92.924302326, 41.4536194 ], [ -92.923082053, 41.452805367 ], [ -92.922212989, 41.45194889 ], [ -92.920395067, 41.450394086 ], [ -92.917634736, 41.448067594 ], [ -92.916581271, 41.447065051 ], [ -92.914990784, 41.445752857 ], [ -92.913622545, 41.444886468 ], [ -92.912027822, 41.443758316 ], [ -92.910569702, 41.442817024 ], [ -92.909126798, 41.441904195 ], [ -92.907705769, 41.440739708 ], [ -92.907236792, 41.440210297 ], [ -92.906791996, 41.439728275 ], [ -92.906063561, 41.438900844 ], [ -92.90546279, 41.43810848 ], [ -92.904683426, 41.43706751 ], [ -92.903805657, 41.435757079 ], [ -92.903083508, 41.434995764 ], [ -92.902434136, 41.434143315 ], [ -92.901556383, 41.432705078 ], [ -92.900602101, 41.43101836 ], [ -92.90006071, 41.43008707 ], [ -92.899299398, 41.429037993 ], [ -92.898343954, 41.427725926 ], [ -92.897155046, 41.426258633 ], [ -92.895640789, 41.424756356 ], [ -92.893260939, 41.422621818 ], [ -92.892079464, 41.421477303 ], [ -92.890906021, 41.420062068 ], [ -92.89038591, 41.419474449 ], [ -92.889597872, 41.418758385 ], [ -92.888233774, 41.417718474 ], [ -92.885736548, 41.415851117 ], [ -92.884730331, 41.414942343 ], [ -92.883733114, 41.414134011 ], [ -92.882803245, 41.413392643 ], [ -92.880824906, 41.411935253 ], [ -92.878421132, 41.410390338 ], [ -92.877082943, 41.409452253 ], [ -92.875736885, 41.408433682 ], [ -92.874592775, 41.407472868 ], [ -92.874046687, 41.407017506 ], [ -92.87345829, 41.406570326 ], [ -92.872908518, 41.40619762 ], [ -92.872386422, 41.405886034 ], [ -92.871763279, 41.405588341 ], [ -92.871170972, 41.405375675 ], [ -92.870586516, 41.405184219 ], [ -92.869926248, 41.405072364 ], [ -92.869127218, 41.40499865 ], [ -92.868246182, 41.40497934 ], [ -92.866535543, 41.404956865 ], [ -92.864101987, 41.404950557 ], [ -92.861199513, 41.404827104 ], [ -92.859698051, 41.404730951 ], [ -92.858853556, 41.404535054 ], [ -92.857756673, 41.40408548 ], [ -92.857267177, 41.403720998 ], [ -92.856789787, 41.403428276 ], [ -92.856434492, 41.403158654 ], [ -92.856008793, 41.402734025 ], [ -92.855634704, 41.402281909 ], [ -92.855179401, 41.401801186 ], [ -92.854705223, 41.401232431 ], [ -92.854343813, 41.400878001 ], [ -92.853903874, 41.400566909 ], [ -92.853399324, 41.400066294 ], [ -92.852847061, 41.399226223 ], [ -92.852259213, 41.398035417 ], [ -92.851773338, 41.396695737 ], [ -92.850742887, 41.394676559 ], [ -92.850013239, 41.393088416 ], [ -92.849752687, 41.39233104 ], [ -92.84945574, 41.391575011 ], [ -92.848726007, 41.390040339 ], [ -92.848285639, 41.389185596 ], [ -92.84775376, 41.388354882 ], [ -92.847160722, 41.387552337 ], [ -92.846727861, 41.387029965 ], [ -92.846108417, 41.386465972 ], [ -92.845116792, 41.385513931 ], [ -92.844628351, 41.38496767 ], [ -92.844176073, 41.384435504 ], [ -92.843808453, 41.383808594 ], [ -92.843330073, 41.382891325 ], [ -92.842988933, 41.382499825 ], [ -92.84264616, 41.382275505 ], [ -92.84217398, 41.382007465 ], [ -92.841307015, 41.381780435 ], [ -92.840459936, 41.381470407 ], [ -92.839385738, 41.381137347 ], [ -92.83858309, 41.380805763 ], [ -92.837667392, 41.380450461 ], [ -92.836653766, 41.380146574 ], [ -92.835521606, 41.379731421 ], [ -92.834447042, 41.379316154 ], [ -92.833754184, 41.379062111 ], [ -92.833126466, 41.378845053 ], [ -92.83260116, 41.378606982 ], [ -92.83199643, 41.378339206 ], [ -92.831194463, 41.377905444 ], [ -92.830133418, 41.377404144 ], [ -92.829521668, 41.377030476 ], [ -92.828955885, 41.376638854 ], [ -92.827231836, 41.375930495 ], [ -92.82553829, 41.375194352 ], [ -92.8233055, 41.374304051 ], [ -92.821172819, 41.373413111 ], [ -92.820305288, 41.373035494 ], [ -92.819457338, 41.372591744 ], [ -92.818556103, 41.371815666 ], [ -92.817769522, 41.371029496 ], [ -92.817004828, 41.370128366 ], [ -92.816475605, 41.369464518 ], [ -92.815902379, 41.368989933 ], [ -92.815208426, 41.368432171 ], [ -92.81420498, 41.368007002 ], [ -92.813155638, 41.367723973 ], [ -92.812318811, 41.367551578 ], [ -92.811074444, 41.367525958 ] ] } },

The tornado traveled southeast on the western side of the Iowa River producing extensive crop and tree damage. The tornado strengthened quickly and took on a wedge appearance as it entered northwest Marshalltown. The tornado tracked more easterly as it entered town producing widespread EF1 and EF2 damage. The tornado went directly through the business district of Marshalltown with EF2 and EF3 damage to many structures including the county courthouse which lost the spire off the clock tower. The tornado continued east through housing areas before encountering the Lennox plant on the east side of town, producing EF3 damage once again. The tornado began to weaken rapidly after this point and dissipated near power plant located on the east side of town. The tornado produced a total of 22 direct injuries.

It hit a farmstead, destroying 3 barns and severely damaging 4 other out buildings. The tornado was rated EF2 at this location with maximum wind speeds of 112 mph. The tornado continued moving northeastward, hitting several other outbuildings and snapping trees. The tree and outbuilding damage was classified as EF1 damage with wind speeds of 100-110mph. As the tornado continued to the northeast it snapped more large trees and then hit a log home, removing 25-50% of the roof material. It also snapped many other trees on this property and destroyed a couple of small outbuildings, throwing the debris northward into a field. The tornado was rated EF2 at this location with wind speeds of 115mph. The tornado continued northeastward and moved into a wooded area, snapping and uprooting hundreds of trees along its path. It then curved north-northeastward and moved into Hewittville, a small community on the southern edge of Taylorville. Here the tornado destroyed or severely damaged multiple houses. The first house the tornado hit lost most exterior walls and the entire roof, except for the roof over the attached garage, which was on the north side of the house. It also destroyed a second garage on the property and then completely destroyed a mobile home across the street. The tornado was rated EF3 with wind speeds around 150mph at this location. The tornado continued north-northeastward, destroying a barn, pushing an unanchored home off its foundation and completely destroying another mobile home. This mobile home was partially anchored by wood posts set in slots on a concrete foundation over a basement and crawl space. The resident of this home was badly injured and was found unconscious, trapped under debris in the crawl space. The tornado was rated EF3 with wind speeds of 140mph at this location. As the tornado continued, it snapped and uprooted many more trees and took down power lines and power poles. Many more homes were damaged, to a lesser extent than the first few on the south end of town, with some damage to the homes coming from trees or tree branches falling on the homes. As the tornado moved into the northern part of Hewittville, the wind speeds seemed to increase, completely destroying another home and destroying a large, old building that had been part of an old rail-yard. The tornado also damaged other homes and garages in this area. The tornado was rated EF3 with wind speeds of 155mph at this location. As the tornado tracked north-northeastward, it moved into Taylorville, taking down more trees, power lines/poles, and damaging multiple houses. Several homes lost roofs and garages. The tornado continued through Taylorville damaging other homes and several businesses on West Spresser St. and was rated EF2 with wind speeds of 120-125mph at this point. As the tornado crossed Hwy 29 into the northern part of town, it weakened considerably, with the damage becoming less severe and more sporadic. The tornado dissipated 1.8 miles north of Taylorville at 5:25 PM CST. In total, the tornado impacted 506 structures...including major damage to 61 homes and 7 businesses and complete destruction of 28 homes.
