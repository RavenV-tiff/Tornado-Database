The tornado began near the intersection of U.S. Highway 43 and County Road 54 where damage to cedar trees was observed. The tornado continued east through a heavily forested area and crossed French Creek. Tree damage was observed along County Road 1. The tornado moved further east crossing Alabama Highway 69 where, on the north side, a large tree crushed the south side of a single wide mobile home. Further south, on the south side of the path, near Windsor Drive and Alabama Highway 69, a large farm equipment building lost its roof and walls while wooden supports remained intact. Two mobile homes nearby sustained minor damage to their roofs and siding on the south side. A recreational camper was blown over and crushed a vehicle. Trees were uprooted and split in the vicinity. The tornado pushed east, paralleling Windsor Drive, and caused additional damage to trees that were either uprooted or split. The damage peaked where a single wide mobile home was lofted and blown to the northeast about 30 feet from its original position. The mobile home was less than a year old but appeared to lack any substantial anchoring system. The walls and roof were completely torn away from the floor base and nearly all of the contents were deposited downwind. This appears to be the climax of the tornado's intensity, and winds were estimated to be near 100 mph. To the south of the mobile home's original position was a metal barn that collapsed and destroyed. The tornado made a slight turn to the northeast where it caused damage to an agricultural crop sprinkler system and snapped a power pole along Allenville Road. It then crossed U.S. Highway 80 and damaged two road signs and caused timber damage. The tornado continued northeast and crossed into Hale County near Cottonwood Creek. The National Weather Service surveyed damage in southeast Hale County and determined the damage was consistent with an EF0 tornado, with maximum sustained winds near 65 mph. This tornado was a continuation of a tornado that began near Highway 43 in Marengo County.

Despite this intense damage, an open-sided outbuilding just 25 yards away suffered no visible damage. Continuing northeast, the tornado snapped several more trees before destroying two more outbuildings, scattering debris a quarter of a mile downwind.

This tornado intensified shortly after crossing into Winn Parish along Highway 84, where it caused considerable tree damage in the Kisatchie National Forest before the tornado started to take a more northeasterly turn near the southern sections of Saline Lake. The tornado began to parallel Lakeshore Drive northeastward where it uprooted and split several hardwood trees along Lakeshore Drive and Mulligan Inn Loop. Several homes along the east bank of Saline Lake received structural damage from trees falling onto the homes. In this area, the tornado was at its strongest near 105 mph and reached its greatest width. The tornado continued northeastward causing sporadic tree damage along Saline Lake Road before it lifted near the vicinity of Coldwater Road just southwest of the community of Calvin.", "F_scale": 1, "Wind": null, "Source": "NWS Storm Survey", "State_1": "LA", "State_2": null, "State_3": null }, "geometry": { "type": "LineString", "coordinates": [ [ -93.0195, 31.8059 ], [ -92.9485, 31.8189 ], [ -92.8406, 31.9617 ] ] } },

This is where the tornado was at its widest with other snapped trees noted along County Road 169. The last of the damage was found on County Road 817 with a metal roof from a house peeled off and thrown behind the house.

Three homes in the area sustained roof and siding damage, including a 2x4 from one of the outbuildings blown through an exterior wall.\nThe tornado became elevated as it continued east-northeast from Thomas Rd, snapping a few tree limbs in a wooded area before briefly touching down one last time on Rineyville Rd, where it littered the highway with tree limbs and tore the front porch off a home, vaulting the roof over the house into the back yard.

Initial damage was to a tractor trailer which was blown over on Interstate 95 just north of the Fort McHenry Tunnel. A few trees were topped just west of the interstate, and a fence line blew over on South Newkirk Street just to the east. This damage is consistent with winds of about 70 MPH.\nThe tornado tracked generally eastward roughly parallel to Holabird Avenue. It blew in large garage doors on both side of the building at Flexi-Van Leasing facility, consistent with wind speeds over 90 MPH.\nAs it continued eastward, it impacted the north building of the Amazon sorting facility, reaching a peak intensity of around 105 MPH. It blew the roof off a portion of the building, including iron rafters. With the loss of the roof, the eight inch concrete wall panels pushed in and collapsed into the building towards the north end of the west wall. Two fatalities occurred inside the building with the wall collapse. About a dozen truck trailers were pushed over, moved, or rolled by the wind. Two of the trailers were noted to have been blown in an opposite direction of the wind that toppled the wall. Several light stanchions and signs were blown over, and several car windows were blown out by flying debris. Radar data from the FAA's Terminal Doppler Weather Radar near Baltimore-Washington International Thurgood Marshall Airport indicated this was around 9:43 PM EDT, and this is when the strongest velocity signature was noted.\nThe tornado continued east along the south side of Holabird Avenue, uprooting several large trees, and snapping dozens of large branches, consistent with winds of about 80 MPH.\nDamage along the entire path was mainly convergent, and while much of the damage was from west-southwest to east-northeast, there were several notable exceptions of damage in differing directions. An eyewitness fire fighter outside the Baltimore City Fire Department Engine 50 firehouse in the area saw the swirling debris and funnel cloud as it passed. The tornado lifted as it reached the intersection with Dundalk Avenue, which according to radar would have been at about 9:44 PM EDT. A tornado tracked eastward from Baltimore City into southern Baltimore County near the city of Dundalk, around 9:44 PM EDT. After it initially lifted, the tornado briefly touched down one last time at the Holabird East Apartments on 4 Georges Court in Dundalk. The two adjoined northeast buildings in the complex sustained significant roofing damage, with a large portion of the roof decking removed from the windward side. The building was deemed uninhabitable displacing 42 people. The strong southwest wind hit the building broadside causing the damage. No other damage was noted in the area. A resident reported swirling winds with the event. One resident in the building was treated for cuts. This was the last area of damage, and the tornado signature on radar weakened after this point just after 9:45 PM EDT.

A house off CR 141 had its windows broken and some roofing material removed, several vehicles were pushed aside, and two campers were lifted and moved. The inhabitants took shelter in their basement upon receiving the warning and were unharmed. The tornado tracked further northeast along CR 141, mainly snapping and uprooting trees. The tornado reached peak intensity of 105 mph off CR 10, where a single family home was more heavily damaged, and a nearby barn was completely destroyed. Fortunately nobody was in the home at the time. The tornado reached its peak width along CR 259, where numerous trees were snapped and uprooted in a wooded area. Additional tree damage was noted along CR 10, and again along CR 259 just south of where it crosses intoTennessee. At this point, the tornado crossed into Wayne County, Tennessee. This is a continuation of a tornado that started in Lauderdale County, Alabama. The tornado crossed into Tennessee and caused EF0 damage, blowing down dozens of trees and causing minor roof damage to a home on May Branch Loop. As the tornado moved northeast, it uprooted many trees and ended up destroying an outbuilding and causing minor roof damage to a home on Middle Cypress Creek Road. Finally, it crossed George Olive Road, did some minor shingle damage to a home and rolled several large bales of hay through a field before lifting.

The tornado continued northeast and when it crossed South Ball Park Road, it demolished 2 hay barns and caused minor roof damage to 2 homes.
