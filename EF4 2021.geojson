The tornado formed west of Franklin near Redland Road north of Highway 34 producing minor damage to trees. The tornado traveled east-northeast gradually gaining intensity and producing more widespread damage to trees and power lines along highway 34 west of Franklin. The tornado grew in size and strength as it entered Franklin and crossed the Chattahoochee River with winds around 130 mph and a path width around 850 yards. Damage in Franklin was extensive with several homes heavily damaged or destroyed. Two homes had roofs blown completely off and a large stand of pine trees was completely snapped or uprooted on the north side of Franklin. A large wall and the roof of a large industrial building on Mary Johnson Drive were ripped off. The tornado continued east-northeast from Franklin to the south of Highway 34 snapping and uprooting trees before crossing into Coweta County around 11:54 PM south of Highway 34 between Charlie B Johnson Road and Bob Wilson Road. A National Weather Service survey determined that an EF4 tornado with maximum wind speeds 170 MPH and a maximum path width of 1850 yards occurred in Coweta County. The Heard County tornado crossed into Coweta County along Bob Wilson Road and gained strength as it moved east-northeast crossing JD Walton Road and travelled up Smokey Road with trees falling on some homes. Wind speeds quickly increased to over 150 MPH, EF3 intensity, near Timberland Trail on the southwest side of Newnan. Many homes had major damage and one home had all but the back wall collapse. The family survived with no injuries by taking shelter in their bathtub. The tornado continued east-northeast crossing Smokey Road and Belk Road where it reached its maximum intensity of 170 MPH, EF4 intensity, as it entered the western city limits of Newnan. One home at the end of Fairview Drive had all exterior and interior walls removed. Four homes along Arlington Court north of Lagrange St were destroyed with one having all exterior and interior walls removed, but leaving a vehicle nearly untouched in what was the garage. As the tornado moved east of Boone Drive, it directly struck Newnan High School and the surrounding athletics fields causing broken windows and doors and extensive roof and structural damage. A portion of the second-story brick wall near the front of the main campus building collapsed. One man died after he suffered a heart attack while trying to reach his daughter's home in a heavily damaged neighborhood after the storm had passed and first responders were unable to reach him due to the large amounts of debris in the area. The tornado weaken from this point onward continuing into the southern part of downtown Newnan, passing directly over the county Justice Center and adjacent administrative building which houses the 911 facility. Extensive roof and window damage along with some interior wind and water damage occurred at the facility. Numerous homes continued to receive damage from winds and falling trees as the tornado moved east-northeast crossing E Broad Street and Greison Trail with 120 to 135 MPH wind speeds. The tornado weakened further as it crossed I-85, causing only minor damage to trees and businesses on the southern end of the Ashley Park shopping center and a hospital. The tornado did re-intensify near the Windsong and White Oak neighborhoods around Shenandoah Boulevard and White Oak Drive east of the Newnan city limits, with max winds of 120 MPH. The tornado continued east-northeast weakening again but still producing damage to trees and power lines, some falling on homes as it crossed Sullivan Road and Lora Smith Road before passing over the Thomas Crossroads area. In neighborhoods south of Andrew Baily Road and north of Highway 34, several homes received damage from falling trees. The tornado continued weakening with more sporadic damage to several trees as it continued east-northeast crossing Fisher Road and Minix Road and moving into Fayette County. A National Weather Service survey determined that an EF0 tornado with maximum wind speeds 75 MPH and a maximum path width of 800 yards occurred in Fayette County. The Heard-Coweta County tornado moved east-northeast into Fayette County and northern Peachtree City crossing Line Creek east of Minix Road. It snapped a few trees near MacDuff Parkway where new homes were being constructed. Portable restrooms and light construction materials were also blown around. A few trees were downed on the CSX railroad tracks near Senoia Road and along Highway 74 near Kedron Drive. Large trees blocked the entrance to the Kedron Hills neighborhood at Loring Lane and Peachtree Parkway. The tornado finally ended near Astoria Lane at the northeast end of Kedron Hills in Peachtree City.", "Source": "NWS Storm Survey" }, "geometry": { "type": "LineString", "coordinates": [ [ -85.189520906, 33.253278358 ], [ -85.153729508, 33.259379133 ], [ -85.121175619, 33.27357768 ], [ -85.093709799, 33.284771467 ], [ -85.046846243, 33.300985561 ], [ -84.998094412, 33.313610379 ], [ -84.960672232, 33.317196641 ], [ -84.900762411, 33.327380822 ], [ -84.883252951, 33.332974443 ], [ -84.859907004, 33.345451227 ], [ -84.835359427, 33.358499743 ], [ -84.829229686, 33.361277677 ], [ -84.823707911, 33.363488013 ], [ -84.816605422, 33.365136768 ], [ -84.80837998, 33.367024434 ], [ -84.794332358, 33.37082951 ], [ -84.774591299, 33.37670704 ], [ -84.753305289, 33.384017559 ], [ -84.729272696, 33.392617383 ], [ -84.686229906, 33.405512067 ], [ -84.683236561, 33.406986871 ], [ -84.680239639, 33.408082509 ], [ -84.648528776, 33.415056055 ], [ -84.626148424, 33.422629003 ], [ -84.602630816, 33.431057869 ], [ -84.596039735, 33.434949676 ], [ -84.579070293, 33.440569208 ], [ -84.570465765, 33.443066992 ], [ -84.562417838, 33.44548759 ] ] } }
