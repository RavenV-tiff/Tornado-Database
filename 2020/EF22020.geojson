The tornado then crossed the far southeast corner of Barksdale Air Force Base where at least one hundred trees were snapped or uprooted. After the tornado exited the corner of Barksdale Air Force Base, it strengthened south of Haughton to produce its most significant damage, completely destroying a single-wide manufactured home and a double-wide manufactured home off of Davis Road. Two fatalities (a 79 year old male and his 65 year old wife) occurred in the double-wide with an additional fatality (an 87 year old male) occurring in the single-wide. The tornado continued to produce roof damage and uproot and snap trees which fell into homes in Eastern Bossier Parish, concentrated most along James Lane. The tornado continued moving northeast across Oliver Road and Camp Zion Road, where numerous trees were snapped and uprooted, while also removing siding off of a single-wide manufactured home, and ripping a portion of the metal exterior and doors off of the Bossier Parish Fire District 1 Station 6 building, as well as tearing off some vinyl siding to a mobile home living quarters located next door, before crossing over into Webster Parish. This is the continuation of the Bossier Parish EF-2 tornado. This tornado weakened slightly as it crossed Pilgrim Rest Road, and tracked northeast before entering the southern sections of Doyline, downing hundreds of trees as it crossed Highways 163 and 164, before entering the extreme southeast corner of Camp Minden. The tornado then tore through the town of Sibley and the northern fringes of Dubberly, where it downed trees and power lines, damaged a metal barn, the roof of a home, and destroyed a shed on Wallraven Road. An 18-wheeler trailer was overturned at the South Webster Industrial Park in Sibley, and a building, fencing, and equipment were damaged at an oil field service company at the park. Just before the tornado crossed Interstate 20 between exits 49 and 52, it developed a much wider swath of damaging straight line winds with its rear flank downdraft near and just south of the tornado track. In fact, a large sign was blown over onto an 18-wheeler at Love's Truckstop at I-20 Exit 49 (Highway 531). After it crossed Interstate 20 southeast of Minden, the tornado then rolled a single-wide mobile home on Fuller Cemetery Road near the Nine Forks community and damaged the roofs of two structures before it moved into Southwest Claiborne Parish. The tornadic winds as it tracked through Southern Webster Parish did weaken slightly from its estimated maximum winds in Eastern Bossier Parish, and ranged from 95-110 mph, which is in the EF-1 range. At least 120 broken power poles and over 250 spans of downed wire were the result of this tornado and associated widespread damaging winds near Doyline, Sibley, Dubberly, and Minden. Significant damage was done to the major power distribution lines that feed the town of Sibley and the South Webster Industrial District. This is a continuation of the Southern Webster Parish EF-2 tornado. This tornado continued on the ground intermittently east-northeast throughout Southern Claiborne Parish, snapping and uprooting numerous trees as it crossed Harris Road, Old Arcadia Road, Faulk Road, Sherrill Road, and Highway 154 south of Athens. The tornado produced partial roof damage to approximately a half dozen chicken houses and shingle and partial roof damage to several other structures, especially off of Buckner Road, Cook Road, and Highway 519 before finally lifting. In addition, widespread straight line winds estimated at 90-100 mph along the path of the tornado led to extensive tree damage. Estimated maximum winds from this tornado throughout Southern Claiborne Parish ranged from 90-105 mph, consistent with an EF-1 tornado but weaker than the estimated maximum winds near 135 mph that was surveyed in Eastern Bossier Parish. The total track length of this tornado when it initially touched down in Central Bossier Parish to when it lifted in Southern Claiborne Parish was just under 41 miles.", "F_scale": 2, "Wind": 135, "Source": "NWS Storm Survey", "State_1": "LA", "State_2": null, "State_3": null }, "geometry": { "type": "LineString", "coordinates": [ [ -93.587506594, 32.45714300100002 ], [ -93.554444612, 32.467223767 ], [ -93.528787674, 32.477931534 ], [ -93.519259579999982, 32.483107953 ], [ -93.508439362999979, 32.486339359999988 ], [ -93.470673859999977, 32.498154242 ], [ -93.43290835800002, 32.507072290999986 ], [ -93.403808016000028, 32.521256505999986 ], [ -93.388484539, 32.528288915000019 ], [ -93.366990389000023, 32.539378334 ], [ -93.293519318999984, 32.551186245 ], [ -93.271546662999981, 32.555816375 ], [ -93.249230684, 32.569560664999983 ], [ -93.237042726000027, 32.575202446999981 ], [ -93.22554141400002, 32.581393533999972 ], [ -93.20202380500001, 32.591518222 ], [ -93.164258303, 32.59666691000001 ], [ -93.136105837, 32.601526074999981 ], [ -93.112244905000011, 32.61448255900001 ], [ -93.096452059, 32.620034764000025 ], [ -93.057313265, 32.621538427000019 ], [ -92.981198609999979, 32.620381765 ], [ -92.933717073000025, 32.621769756999981 ] ] } },

Thousands of trees were uprooted and snapped along the path along with numerous power lines and poles downed. Some of the heaviest damage was to a mobile home just off Ashley 129 Road. The home was thrown 15 to 20 feet and destroyed. Another mobile home was destroyed along Ashley 128 Road. The tornado then crossed Highway 82 near Ashley 301 Road. Power poles were broken here and a tractor shed was heavily damaged. From this point, the tornado mostly paralleled Highway 82 or tracked along it. Many power lines were down along with poles. Just east of Ashley 912 Road, one wooden high tension segment had the top broken out. In the Snyder community, some homes sustained roof damage and had trees down on them. North of Highway 82, near Horseshoe Lake, a lot of hardwood trees were heavily damaged and there were three segments of the wooden high tension poles and lines taken out. The tornado continued roughly along Highway 82 toward Montrose. The strongest core of the tornado remained north of the highway and downed two more wooden high tension segments before Montrose and two more just north of town to the west of Highway 165. In the town of Montrose, numerous trees were damaged along with many homes having some degree of roof damage or a handful more with a tree on the home. Just east of Montrose, near the Chicot County line and north of Highway 82, a metal high tension pole segment was taken down which supported the highest wind estimate of 130 mph. The tornado dissipated near County Road 293 on the north side of Highway 82. Maximum width was 1000 yards. Total path length was 20.51 miles.

It is at Airport Road where one injury was reported due to a tree falling on a home. It then moved east-northeast to US Highway 278, breaking 8 to 10 wooden electrical poles. It moved to the northeast of the Lake Village community where it continued to knock down wooden electrical poles and began to uproot and snap large branches from softwood trees along North Lakeshore Drive and along the shore of Lake Chicot. The Lake Village Country Club along North Lakeshore Drive took damage to its roof on the backside. In addition, on the backside of the Country Club, a nearby forested area had multiple snapped large hardwood tree limbs in addition to the tin roof of a metal storage building peeled completely off. Also along North Lakeshore Drive, multiple trees were uprooted and snapped at a trailer park, where one trailer was blown across the street to near the bottom of Lake Chicot. As the tornado continued to track northeast, it moved along AR Highway 144, uprooting trees and snapping large hardwood limbs. Five electrical power poles were downed along Highway 144, as well as another trailer getting rolled to near the bottom of Lake Chicot. The tornado continued to snap large limbs and uproot hardwood trees as it moved across Pecan Ridge Drive. The tornado continued to just north of Levee Road where it lifted, but not before a few uprooting hardwood trees and snapping small to medium sized limbs. It is important to note that a large swath of severe wind speeds resulted in widespread downed trees on Lakehall Road, Sunnyside Road, Stuart Island Road and at the Lake Chicot State Park. Several of these trees fell on power lines causing outages to a large portion of the Lake Village community. This tornado then continued east-northeast across the MS River to across Lake Ferguson in Washington County, where the second floor was blown off of a lake house on South Ferguson Road. In addition, a high concentration of snapped and uprooted hardwood trees was noted on the backside of the lakehouse on South Ferguson Road, thus resulting in the upgraded EF-2 rating. It continued to move east to Highway 1 North where it snapped small to large hardwood tree limbs before dissipating. Estimated peak wind with this tornado was 127 mph. Max width was 850 yards.

As it moved east-northeast to the intersection of County Roads 279 and 27, it continued to snap softwood trees and also caused some minor peeling of tin roofs of nearby chicken houses. As the tornado crossed County Road 1816, the snapping of several softwood trees resulted in some of the trees taking down power poles. The tornado then crossed US Highway 503 north of Paulding, MS snapping multiple softwood trees. Thereafter, it moved across County Road 31 continuing its snapping and uprooting of softwood trees, as well as destroying an outdoor metal shed. The snapping and uprooting of softwood trees continued as it crossed US Highway 18, and then moved into Clarke County resulting in multiple snapped and uprooted trees, severely damaging a carport and causing damage to portions of a one-story home along US Highway 513.

Several trees were either uprooted or pushed over, facing from the west-southwest to the east-northeast just west of Highway 231 on Fairview Road. The wind swath was about 200 yards wide. Just east of Highway 231 a large 40 x 60 storage barn for a camper had its roof partially lifted downwind to the east northeast. The metal siding was flung up to 150 yards into the trees. The tree damage continued along Alvaton- Scottsville Road into Marble Gate Ct. Several homes sustained roof damage, with several porches partially lifted up causing structural damage. One home on Marble Gate Court had four 20-pound steel chairs flung about 50 yards and the 35-pound table thrown 25 yards. Portions of the porch covering were blown 125 yards into the yard of their next-door neighbors yard, 2 of which punctured the house like a flying 2 by 4 missile. There were also portions of the deck impaled in the ground. The damage swatch then increased to about 225 yards and winds increased to 80 to 85 mph. There were at least three trees laying on homes.\nJust east off Claypool Boyce Road... there was a distinct change in the tree pattern. Instead of just going to the northeast trees were now going to the northwest, north and northeast. A large 2 x 8 went flying and got wedged between the windshield wiper and the windshield but incredibly did not crack the windshield. This is where a small tornado formed within the straight-line wind path, with winds between 80 and 85 mph. Residents reported half inch hail, followed by a surge in lightning, then quiet, then a 20 second loud roar with popping in their ears followed by complete silence again. Further east in the 500 block of Kara Court, there was significant tree damage with the back of the house being uplifted and insulation being thrown upwind and downwind around the back of the house. Trees were laying in all directions with lots of twisting and many snapped trees. At the 200 block of Cross Creek Court, the clearest evidence of trees are facing all eight inter-cardinal headings. In this area, trees were snapped and uprooted all over the place.\nThe survey team estimated well over 500 trees in a 1 mile stretch had been uprooted snapped or pushed over. Two of the snapped trees landed on pick up trucks. Winds increased to EF1 range of 95 mph and a width of 225 yards. At the 2400 block of WG Talley Road was the most significant damage of the entire survey. Three barns were destroyed, 2 of them were concreted in strong firm footers. One of the barns was 30 x 80, one was 150 x 100, and one was 12 x 16 along with numerous sheds destroyed, and debris was thrown in all directions downwind up to 500 yards. A 5000 pound horse trailer was thrown to the northwest 70 yards.\nA very well-built family residence took a direct hit from an EF2 tornado, with the front side of the home having the plywood exposed and with most of the shingles gone but the rest of the house fully intact due to the house having all the proper clips, braces, and rebar. Wind speeds at this point were 116 mph with a width of 250 yards. EF-1 Tree damage continued into Allen County along Allen Springs Road.

A 96 mph wind gust was measured at a Delaware Department of Transportation weather station located on Route 1 just north of Smyrna as the tornadic circulation passed by. The tornado continued north-northwestward as it crossed Duck Creek into New Castle County. As this tornado crossed into New Castle County, it continued nearly parallel to Routes 1 and 13 on the east sides of Townsend and Middletown. Numerous trees were snapped or uprooted along portions of Blackbird Landing Road and Gum Bush Road in Townsend with some damage to roofs. A garage at a residence on Blackbird Landing Road was destroyed. The tornado then damaged homes in Middletown along Spring Hollow Drive. In this neighborhood, some homes had roof material and siding blown off with numerous trees uprooted. Several garage doors were blown out and one home had an entire side wall blown off. One picture showed a home with a missing exterior corner walls on the second story.\nThe tornado continued north northwest to the Summit Bridge area just south of the C and D canal.

Some other homes lost a portion of their roof and siding was torn off with a garage door blown in, along with several trees down or snapped. The tornado crossed the canal and tracked near Lums Pond and through an adjacent wooded area where pictures and areal footage showed a clear path with numerous trees down. The tornado then crossed Route 896 and into the Brennan Estates where hundreds of trees were down or uprooted and around a dozen homes sustained enough damage that they were declared as uninhabitable. The tornado then looked to have lifted prior to crossing over into Cecil County Maryland.\nBased on the damage to the homes in the Middletown to Summit Bridge to Brennan Estates areas especially (some non-tree related damage), the rating of this tornado was increased to 115 mph which is equivalent to an EF2 on the Enhanced Fujita Scale.

After crossing into Philadelphia County, the tornado continued moving northwest through the Philadelphia Mills Mall and then to Knights Road and Medford Road toward Dunks Ferry Road. Three exhaust systems and 6 RTU systems were blown off the roof in less than 15 seconds at the former Walmart Store currently undergoing reconstruction, and numerous trees, some close to 100 years old, were snapped or blown over along Knights Road, Medford Road, and Dunks Ferry Road. Roofs, siding, and awnings were blown off many homes in the area. A few cars were also tossed or turned over as the storm moved through.
