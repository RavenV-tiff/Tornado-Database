The tornado began 2.5 miles northwest of Baxter along Highway 70 where it caused EF-0 damage to several homes and outbuildings. Scattered trees were blown down as the tornado continued eastward across Gainesboro Highway. The tornado quickly intensified to EF-2 in the Prosperity Pointe subdivision just north of Highway 70 and further strengthened to EF-3 as it crossed Bloomington Road and Clemmons Road in the Double Springs community, severely damaging several homes. As the tornado moved across Charleston Square, Plunk Whitson Road, and North McBloom Chapel Road, it intensified even more and produced a 0.8 mile long by 100 yards wide swath of EF-4 damage. 17 well-constructed, large homes in this area were completely leveled, mostly on Hensley Drive, with many deaths occurring in this area. EF-4 damage continued eastward to Echo Valley Drive, where an apartment complex and 5 more homes were completely destroyed. The tornado weakened to EF-3 as it crossed Highway 70 and Locust Grove Road, where numerous more homes and buildings were damaged or destroyed. A dashcam video of the tornado was taken from an unoccupied vehicle on Willow Brook Drive in this area. Continuing along Highway 70, the tornado weakened further to EF-2 intensity as it crossed County Farm Road and Jackson Street, then down to EF-1 strength along Crescent Drive and Buck Avenue. The tornado rapdily dissipated as it entered the downtown area of Cookeville, quickly lifting on Laurel Avenue just west of Cookeville Regional Medical Center.

It quickly strengthened as it moved northeastward through the Hope area where it produced damage consistent with 115 mph winds. It also quickly grew in width and was roughly 1200 yd/0.67 mi wide in Walthall County by the time it approached Hwy 27. As it crossed Hwy 27 it continued to cause significant damage along East Sartinville Rd. The tornado was strongest as it approached James Ratcliff Rd. Two homes on this road were leveled, one being reduced to a slab. Consultation with subject matter experts including both engineers and experts in forensic tornado damage analysis supports raising the maximum intensity to 170 mph based on the house that was reduced to a slab and a large hard wood tree that was uprooted and tossed several feet from where it stood. The increased wind speed makes the tornado an EF-4 on the Enhanced Fujita scale. The other home that was leveled suffered damage consistent with a high end EF-3. While all walls were collapsed, there was no evidence of bolts that would have held the sill plates to the foundation. Thus, the wind speed for this particular damage is reduced slightly from the expected. As it continued to move northeastward, it continued snapping every tree near the center of its path. It also caused substantial damage to several small cinder block buildings, tore the roof off of a home and rolled a tied down single-wide manufactured home as it crossed East Sartinville Rd. From there it continued northeastward and tore the entire roof from a brick home just before moving into Lawrence County. It should be noted that from just southwest of James Ratcliff Rd through the remainder of the Walthall Co portion of the track, nearly every tree in the path of the tornado was snapped or uprooted.\n\nThe tornado then moved into far southeast Lawrence County, where it began snapping large hardwood branches on JK Givens Road. The tornado started to strengthen as a large swath of broken and uprooted hardwood trees were noted farther along JK Givens Road. As the tornado moved east northeast to Tynes Ainsworth Road, it tossed and completely destroyed a mobile home, causing two fatalities. Concurrently, it also snapped numerous softwood and hardwood trees behind and around the mobile home. The snapping and uprooting of numerous softwood trees continued when it moved northeast across Felix Sartin Road, while also causing some shingles to be removed from a one-story residence. Swaths of snapped hardwood trees and the uproot of trees was noted at Holmes Road, where a few wooden power poles were also snapped. The tornado then trekked into northwest Marion County, causing the snapping of multiple softwood trees just north of Ranch Road. The tornado moved northeast to US Road 587 where it broke a few wooden power poles and continued snapping softwood trees. It continued along its east-northeast path impacting River Road and Cooper Road, and causing large softwood branches to snap and the snapping and uprooting of softwood trees. The uprooting of a few softwood trees was noted when the tornado reached Highway 13, though the amount of uprooted trees was not as impressive from earlier in its track, thus showing a declining in strength. The tornado moved northeast into Jefferson Davis County, resulting in the snapping of a few small softwood tree limbs at Raynes Road. The tornado lifted at Joe Dyess Road, but not before snapping a few small hardwood tree limbs.\nThe total path length of the tornado was 21.17 miles. Maximum width was 1.1 miles in Lawrence County. Maximum estimated wind speed for the tornado was 170mph, and rated an EF4.", "F_scale": 4, "Wind": 170, "Source": "NWS Storm Survey", "State_1": "MS", "State_2": null, "State_3": null }, "geometry": { "type": "LineString", "coordinates": [ [ -90.17321199700001, 31.276275982000016 ], [ -90.150122778000025, 31.292773808 ], [ -90.133213585000021, 31.306751948 ], [ -90.112826321, 31.316943723 ], [ -90.105600924999976, 31.320749492 ], [ -90.092142699000021, 31.327028112999983 ], [ -90.086596247999978, 31.330815418999975 ], [ -90.082341854, 31.333058198 ], [ -90.054036687, 31.34691232900002 ], [ -90.046561601, 31.350217534000024 ], [ -90.033749431999979, 31.354362208 ], [ -90.010762408, 31.363423881000017 ], [ -89.976995279, 31.37251697 ], [ -89.850480844, 31.401678796 ] ] } },

Locations impacted by this tornado include Bassfield, the areas between Collins and Seminary, Soso, Moss, Heidelberg, and Pachuta. This tornado is preliminarily rated EF4 with an estimated peak wind of 190 MPH east of Bassfield in southwestern Jefferson Davis County. Additional EF4 damage was noted near Soso in Jones County and at Moss in Jasper County. The maximum path width was 2.25 miles in the vicinity of Hughes Road west of Seminary in western Covington County. At this width, the tornado ranks 3rd widest in the official NOAA United States tornado database behind the El Reno, OK tornado of 2013 (2.6 mi) and the Hallam, NE tornado of 2004 (2.5 mi). This tornado now ranks as the widest on record in the state of Mississippi, surpassing the Yazoo City, MS tornado of 2010 (1.75 mi). Eight lives were lost in this tornado, and there was an undetermined number of additional injuries. Additional details on the damage path and area of most significant damage follow.\n\nThe tornado began south of Bassfield along Bassfield Cemetery Road, uprooting trees and resulting in relatively minor structural damage. As it proceeded northeastward, the diameter of the wind field steadily increased and the percentage of snapped trees in the center of the vortex increased considerably as the tornado approached MS Highway 42. At this location, two homes sustained major roof damage. Tornado intensity then began to increase quickly, with EF3 damage as it crossed Hosey Mikell Road, completely demolishing a mobile home and scattering the debris field over 300 yards downwind. Tree damage also ramped up significantly beyond this location, with low end EF4 damage in a narrow swath of nearly complete tree destruction along the center of the tornado vortex and increasing instances of debarking of trees as the tornado moved across Pitts Lane and Reese Road. Outside of this most intense corridor of tornadic winds, EF1 and EF2 damage to trees and structures was occurring over a wider area, up one mile wide. In addition, both ground surveys and aerial photography indicated the presence of multiple vortices at times. Intense damage continued as the tornado crossed the intersection of Graves Key Road and Harper Road, where a cinder block small business building was destroyed, with much of the slab swept clean. Four fatalities occurred at this location. Nearby, a mobile home was completely destroyed, with the undercarriage wrapped around the small set of trees that remained standing downwind. Debarking of some trees was again noted and continued along the tornado path across Claude Booth Road.\n\nThe tornado reached its peak intensity as it moved across a field north of Graves Key Road. At this location, the foundation of a wood frame and metal roof cabin was swept clean. A truck parked at this cabin was tossed approximately 300 yards downwind, and trees that remained standing at this site were partially debarked. Though the path of the intense tornado vortex through the field surrounding this cabin was clearly visible, significant scouring was not noted. The tornado continued to remain violent and grow in size, nearly 1.5 miles wide, as it crossed Good Hope Road and continued to track toward the Bouie River. Here, a large swath of extreme tree damage was noted as the whole forest was leveled. An intense core of the tornado was evident by debarking of trees along a well defined center line or sub-vortex feature. Extreme debarking was noted around Willie Fortenberry Road. In this general area, several farmers reported roughly 60 cattle were killed by the tornado. The tornado grew larger as it entered Covington County and peaked in width in the vicinity of Hughes Road. Maximum width was measured at 2.25 miles. The incredible expansive tree damage continued along the path with millions of trees damaged. Several dozen structures were damaged or destroyed between McGowen Circle to US 49. Numerous chicken houses (23-30) were destroyed here as well. A section of Cold Springs Road looked to see another sub- vortex and it was here another area of EF4 damage occurred to a home.\n\nAs the tornado crossed US 49, the width decreased to 1.7 miles, but it remained quite strong with mid to upper end EF3 damage noted. Extreme tree damage persisted in large swaths along the path. In addition, a few dozen structures were damaged between US 49 and MS Highway 588. This consisted of varying degrees of damage from EF1 to EF3 levels. The tornado entered northwestern Jones County near the Centerville community where several homes had shingles blown off or parts of the decking exposed. A mobile home along Tommy Pickering Road was thrown and separated from the frame, with the highest winds in the EF2 range. As the storm moved northeast across US 84, trees were uprooted and snapped. Several homes on both sides of the highway had decking exposed or shingles blown off. At least one mobile home was destroyed along US 84. The tornado intensified to an EF3 causing significant damage to multiple homes along Danny Hillburn Road, where large sections of roofing was removed. Between US 84 and MS Highway 29, several mobile homes were completely destroyed and at least one separated from the frame. Several homes had one or more exterior walls collapsed or large sections of the roof removed. The tornado continued to cause widespread destruction as it moved into the town of Soso. Several homes and churches received significant damage. Large swaths of trees were snapped and uprooted along MS Highway 29. Near the center of town, a fire station was heavily damaged when the overhead doors collapsed and portions of the roof were removed. Numerous homes had roofing removed and exposed decking. The worst damage occurred along MS Highway 28 where a convenience store was destroyed and several other cinder block structures were heavily damaged when the storm intensified to low end EF-4. The tornado continued to mow down large swaths of trees and caused major uplift and loss of roofing to numerous homes as it moved northeast toward MS Highway 15. Along Mathews Road numerous mobile homes and several outbuildings were completely destroyed.\n\nThe tornado intensified to a low end EF4 as it moved into the Moss community, where winds near 175 mph resulted in widespread devastation. Nearly every structure in the community was damaged with the most significant damage occurring along or near MS Highway 537. About half of the First Baptist Church of Moss was completely leveled. Numerous homes were destroyed or had major roofing loss or uplifted. A small pick-up truck was thrown several hundred yards and completely destroyed. In addition, multiple mobile homes were completely demolished.\n\nAs the storm tracked toward I-59 a few miles west of Heidelberg, hundreds of trees were mowed down, outbuildings were destroyed. Several homes and mobile homes had metal roofing peeled back or decking exposed. Large swaths of trees were snapped for several miles including some along I-59 between the Heidelberg and Vossburg exits. Swaths of tree damage continued into the Barnett community. In the town of Pachuta there was scattered tree damage and the metal roofing was peeled off of a church. About two miles north of Pachuta, the damage became sporadic and the tornado lifted in a wooded area along County Road 130.\nThe total path length was 67.43 miles. The maximum estimated wind speed of both the tornado and in Jefferson Davis County was 190mph.", "F_scale": 4, "Wind": 190, "Source": "NWS Storm Survey", "State_1": "MS", "State_2": null, "State_3": null }, "geometry": { "type": "LineString", "coordinates": [ [ -89.758931023, 31.463327729000014 ], [ -89.744396301999984, 31.474056255999983 ], [ -89.737945239, 31.480741438999985 ], [ -89.731761322000011, 31.486527964 ], [ -89.723608680999973, 31.492107874 ], [ -89.720387335999987, 31.493525299 ], [ -89.712451871999974, 31.498831483 ], [ -89.709191026999974, 31.501058839999985 ], [ -89.700678430999972, 31.506377327999985 ], [ -89.693095398000025, 31.510240803999977 ], [ -89.683384285999978, 31.514200677000019 ], [ -89.67837003, 31.517924070999982 ], [ -89.677037981000012, 31.519279805999986 ], [ -89.625965339, 31.544965794 ], [ -89.545971138000027, 31.576253037000015 ], [ -89.463230354000018, 31.628886684 ], [ -89.348560554000017, 31.696681700999989 ], [ -89.297180694000019, 31.724613105 ], [ -89.26871924, 31.750862456 ], [ -89.250026924, 31.767346169 ], [ -89.184320275, 31.811282743999982 ], [ -89.178504491000012, 31.815203757 ], [ -89.033390266000026, 31.903267111 ], [ -88.997030823999978, 31.931746041 ], [ -88.966099007000025, 31.964890450999974 ], [ -88.920812289000025, 32.002972526 ], [ -88.863926154000012, 32.071959056000026 ] ] } },

The tornado then continued northeast, crossing over Highway 321 near the intersection with County Road S-25-35 before gaining strength and causing substantial damage. Beyond this point, the unusually long track and wide tornado damaged and destroyed many residences, including mobile and single family homes along its entire path. A few automobiles were also tossed/rolled 50 to 75 yards from their original locations. In addition, the tornado reached a maximum width of about 0.75 mile, causing extensive damage to thousands of trees and numerous power lines. At times, the damage pattern suggested that the tornado may have consisted of multiple vortices, which can occur in stronger tornadoes.\nThe most significant structural damage occurred just south of Estill, South Carolina and across Nixville, South Carolina, where at least six residences were destroyed. After crossing Highway 321 and continuing a northeast track, the tornado began producing EF-2 to EF-3 damage to residences along Sprayfield Road to Lena Expressway. The tornado then continued northeast where it completely destroyed a mobile home near the intersection of Highway 3 and Highway 601, tragically claiming the lives of 2 adult males. Continuing on a northeast track, the tornado heavily damaged homes near the intersection of Turner Expressway and Brandy Lane, including completely destroying a mobile home that tragically claimed the lives of 2 adult females and 1 adult male. The tornado then reached peak EF-4 intensity along Lento Road where the roof and all exterior/interior walls of a two story home were removed and dispersed across the yard. The tornado then began a weakening trend while tracking further northeast, eventually crossing Highway 278, Yemassee Highway and ending approximately 1 mile beyond the intersection of Old Salkehatchie Highway and Archie Road before the Hampton/Colleton County line.\nOverall, the tornado path stretched approximately 24 miles, claiming the lives of 5 individuals in the hardest hit areas just south of Estill, South Carolina and across Nixville, South Carolina. Additionally, 60 people sustained injuries associated with the tornado tracking through this hardest hit area, including a few individuals that were thrown 30 to 50 yards from mobile homes and individuals that were in homes that received EF-3 to EF-4 damage.", "F_scale": 4, "Wind": 175, "Source": "NWS Storm Survey", "State_1": "SC", "State_2": null, "State_3": null }, "geometry": { "type": "LineString", "coordinates": [ [ -81.289945252999985, 32.704450176000023 ], [ -81.230940944999986, 32.732066105 ], [ -81.209737668, 32.738955751999981 ], [ -81.200509674999978, 32.742828891999977 ], [ -81.158452638000028, 32.760983523 ], [ -81.122618325000019, 32.773289031 ], [ -81.072450288000027, 32.788767738 ], [ -81.00876391700001, 32.806516225 ], [ -80.912976868999976, 32.828155927000012 ], [ -80.909200317999989, 32.829021405 ] ] } },

Bethel Road and Highway 48. Significant tree damage and minor damage to a few homes was observed along the path of the tornado. Peak wind intensity for the Walthall County segment was 110 mph. Survey completed by WFO Jackson MS. This violent tornado began over southeastern Walthall County in a field just west of Reagan Road and moved east northeastward along MS Highway 48, producing significant tree damage and minor damage to a few homes. It crossed into Marion County near the intersection of MS Highway 48 and Mt Bethel Road. The tornado then began to move more northeastward as it moved into southwestern Marion County, uprooting and snapping several softwood trees, causing minor roof damage to a home, and destroying an outdoor small shed along New Hope Road. It also snapped several trees and peeled the tin roof of a barn along A Pittman, Marks and Davis Roads. The tornado intensified relatively quickly once it moved northeast, snapping the majority of trees close to the ground in a wooded area east of New Hope Road. The basis for the low-end EF4 rating was a home on Johnson Road that was completely destroyed with its debris pushed to a corner of the foundation leaving residual vinyl flooring and a few of its anchor bolts bent. Furthermore, across the street from the aforementioned home, in a field a few of the snapped trees sustained patchy debarking. A higher rating was not assigned because the contents of the home were not spread a significant distance from the foundation and debris remained over a part of the slab. Nonetheless, significant damage to the home and nearby trees occurred. In addition, multiple wooden power poles were snapped, several other homes had significant roof damage and multiple mobile homes were completely destroyed, resulting in one fatality. Continual uprooting and snapping of trees was observed at Hurricane Creek Road, in addition to minor roof damage to a shed and a one-story home. When the tornado crossed Hurricane Creek Church Road, it caused significant roof damage to the Hurricane Creek Baptist Church and the nearby pastor's home. Behind the pastor's home was a large 40-foot shed that sat partially on cinder blocks and partially on a slab that was bolted down. This shed was completely destroyed as it was blown a few feet away. Several headstones in a cemetery were knocked over at this location as well. Additional roof damage to multiple homes and the uprooting and snapping of numerous trees along Hurricane Creek Road to the intersection of MS Highway 35. When the tornado reached MS Highway 35, it snapped multiple wooden power-poles and continued snapping trees. It continued east- northeast to Old MS Highway 35 causing numerous snapping of hardwood trees and the removal of a portion of a one-story home roof. The tornado continued moving east-northeast across the Pearl River bottom, when it reached MS Highway 43, multiple wooden power-poles were snapped, some minor roof damage occurred to some one-story homes and hardwood trees were snapped. Just east of MS Highway 43 along Joe Magee Road, a brick home sustained significant damage as the roof was completely destroyed and a few exterior walls were collapsed. A swath of snapped softwood trees was noted along Abrams Road thus producing EF2 damage.\nOnce the tornado reached MS Highway 13 and surrounding streets such as Pine Burr Road and Firetower Road near the Marion and Lamar county borders, a slight decline in strength was noted, though its path remained wide. Although, it was still snapping large tree limbs and snapping and uprooting some softwood trees, several of which fell onto wooden power poles and caused them to fall. The tornado maintained its east northeastward track, knocking thousands of trees down along with numerous power lines and poles down across the western portions of Lamar County. This tree damage was consistent with high end EF1 winds peaking between 100-110 mph. Around a dozen homes were damaged starting from Luther Saucier Rd to Purvis to Columbia Road, including one old mobile home that was completely destroyed. As the tornado continued to track east northeastward to the north of Purvis. It crossed Purvis Oloh Road, MS Highway 589 along with US 11. Hundreds of trees were damaged along with many power lines down. Some minor damage occurred to some homes. The tornado was slightly weaker here with winds between 90- 100mph. The tornado crossed I-59 into Forrest County along Ford and Elks Lodge Road in the Dixie community. Hundreds of trees were damaged along with many power lines down. Sheds and several homes had minor damage and one mobile home had the roof blown off. The tornado then crossed US 49 a couple miles north of Southgate Road. The tornado proceeded into Camp Shelby. At Camp Shelby, there were widespread snapped and uprooted trees. Multiple structures across the north half, in and around Lee Avenue to Glenn Walker Lake, had varying degrees of minor to moderate roof damage from the tornado or fallen trees. The park and camper area on the north end of the lake was impacted. One person was injured here as a large tree fell on a truck.
