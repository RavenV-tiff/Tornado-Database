This survey, coupled with radar analysis from the KLWX WSR-88D and the FAA's TIAD Terminal Doppler Weather Radar, concluded that a tornado rated EF0 on the Enhanced Fujita Scale impacted the Town of Leesburg between 7:20 AM EST and 7:23 AM EST. The tornado had a path length of 3.3 miles producing intermittent damage, with a path width of up to 250 yards. The tornado was moving northeast at approximately 60 mph.\nThe first damage was reported in the Greenway Farm and Linden Hill subdivision in SW Leesburg. Here numerous large tree limbs were downed along with several trees completely uprooted. The damage was determined to be concentrated between Lawford Drive and Nickels Drive in a wooded area, and also along Governors Drive and Country Club Drive. TIAD radar was showing a rotational signature beginning at 7:20 AM in these locations. Wind gusts in this area were estimated to be 65 MPH from radar analysis and damage indicators.\nThe tornado then lifted over Route 7, with just some minor tree damage noted in the 800 block of Davis Court SE. The historic downtown portion of the Town of Leesburg, near King and Market Streets, was spared with just minimal damage. The only noteworthy damage that was observed was tree damage along Monroe Street.\nAs the tornado moved into NE Leesburg, both the radar and the storm survey indicated that it became much stronger. Two areas of widespread, concentrated tree damage were found. The first one was in the vicinity of Lounsberry Road NE and the Exeter Subdivision; which are north of Edwards Ferry Road and south of Battlefield Parkway NE. A townhome on Ginger Square NE had its siding and underlayment completely peeled off, exposing it's roof trusses. Many homes along Marshall Drive NE also had roofing damage, along with trees uprooted and large branches downed. One house had lawn furniture lifted and blown in the opposite direction of the way the trees were fallen and debris was plastered on cars and homes. Damage was noted spanning the 500 and 600 blocks of Marshall Drive NE, which supports the damage width estimate of 250 yards. The other area of concentrated wind damage was north of Battlefield Parkway NE, in and around the Fieldstone Apartment complex. Here, fifteen to twenty 1.5-2.0 foot diameter pines were uprooted. Of special note was a line of 5 large pine trees in the easternmost portion of the apartment complex which were uprooted and which fell onto two unoccupied vehicles. Several of these trees did fall in a convergent pattern. Additional large pine trees were uprooted along the US Route 15 Leesburg Bypass near its intersection with Battlefield Parkway NE.\nAnalysis from TIAD radar showed velocity measurements up to 77 knots at approximately 210 feet above ground level as the tornado was in the vicinity of the Fieldstone Apartments. Taking into account some decrease in the wind's magnitude as it got closer to ground level, along with the damage indicated in and around the Fieldstone Apartments, corroborates estimated wind gusts of up to 85 mph.\nThe NWS Baltimore/Washington Weather Forecast Office thanks the Loudoun County Office of Emergency Management with providing information supporting the storm survey.", "F_scale": 0, "Wind": 85, "Source": "NWS Storm Survey", "State_1": "VA", "State_2": null, "State_3": null }, "geometry": { "type": "LineString", "coordinates": [ [ -77.587341528000024, 39.094625945000018 ], [ -77.568544606999978, 39.102369359000022 ], [ -77.554382542999974, 39.118319777000011 ], [ -77.543310384, 39.128640669999982 ] ] } },

It began in the southeast part of Sandisfield (Berkshire County), moved northeast across northwest Tolland (Hampden County), and lifted in the southern portion of Blandford (Hampden County). Damage was mainly to trees but some minor home damage occurred in Sandisfield. The EF-Scale rating was EF-0, with estimated maximum wind speeds of 80 mph. The tornado was on the ground in a mainly continuous path for a little more than 8 miles, with a maximum width of approximately 100 yards.\nThe tornado began in Sandisfield, just west of South Main Street. Some tree damage was observed on Carpenter Lane and on South Main Street at and just north of the Mile 4 marker. A home there had its upper window blown in, shingles ripped off, and the portico was lifted upward, enabling the supporting post to be shifted outward. Some corn stalks were flattened and a neighbor's fence was blown down.\nIn Tolland, trees were observed to be blown down in various directions from East Otis Road to the west shore of Twining Pond, where drone footage provided by an amateur radio operator showed a couple of dozen trees blown down in a narrow swath. Continuing to the northeast, many trees were downed on Belden Road and on a narrow portion of Schoolhouse Road just north of Belden Road. The damage became sporadic as it ended with some wires downed in Blandford, just west of the north end of the Cobble Mountain Reservoir. One tree was observed down near the Blandford Highway Department on Otis Stage Road (Route 23).", "F_scale": 0, "Wind": 80, "Source": "NWS Storm Survey", "State_1": "MA", "State_2": null, "State_3": null }, "geometry": { "type": "LineString", "coordinates": [ [ -73.0769, 42.0911 ], [ -73.0738, 42.0939 ], [ -72.9471, 42.1648 ] ] } },

This consisted mainly of smaller size limbs of a pine tree or other softwood tree. On the east side of Highway 33, 1 large pine tree was snapped just above the base and another tree was uprooted. The stronger damage was pointed toward the northeast, with some lighter convergent damage toward the southeast or into the path of the storm.\nThe pine tree that was snapped looked to have some disease and the uprooted tree was in a very swampy area of the gameland, thus probably had a lower threshold for uprooting. These two factors along with the lack of any appreciable damage nearby was enough to rate the tornado on the lower end of the scale or an EF0 with top winds of around 70 MPH.\nNote, the path length could be much longer but due to the remote area surveyed, it could not be followed for it's entirety.", "F_scale": 0, "Wind": 70, "Source": "NWS Storm Survey", "State_1": "NC", "State_2": null, "State_3": null }, "geometry": { "type": "LineString", "coordinates": [ [ -76.6066, 35.2594 ], [ -76.6052, 35.2602 ] ] } },

Damage was sparse in this area, but a velocity couplet developed over this location when viewed by the nearby NEXRAD KDOX in Dover Delaware. There was also a small area of low correlation coefficient values coinciding this velocity couplet, suggestive of a tornado debris signature (TDS). This signature moved in a northeasterly direction roughly three to four miles northwest of the small town of Henderson, MD. Two areas of damage occurred along this linear path created by the TDS, the first being to a residence along Trunk Line Road just to the east of the intersection with Taylor Road. Here, a small horse barn was completely destroyed, with its roof being blown across a yard into a nearby house and several sides falling down. This resulted in damage to the roof, siding, and chimney of the home. Several trees and branches were also uprooted and broken in the vicinity. No damage was reported for roughly 1.4 miles as the tornado moved to the northeast, with the base perhaps lifting at times. A second area of damage occurred at a chicken farm on Shults Road between the intersections with Hecht and Zion Roads. Here, two barns were destroyed with the roof being lifted and tossed off of one and peeled back and twisted on the second. It is unclear if any damage occurred to the chicken barns that were located behind these two barns or to any of the poultry. From there, the TDS continued northeastward for another 1.4 miles before disappearing right before the Delaware Border just south of the small town of Templeville, MD in Caroline County. It is at this point that we estimate the tornado to have lifted based on trends in the corresponding velocity couplet and TDS from radar.
