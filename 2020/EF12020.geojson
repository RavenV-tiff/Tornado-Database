The back part of the barn was thrown to the west while a wagon in the trailer was pushed out through the barn. A 72' x 12' shed next to the barn was destroyed. Parts of that barn were impaled into the ground 75 to 80 yards down wind. The tornado was at its widest at 45 yards here with 95 mph winds. Another remarkable thing is the family house was only 60 yards from the damage path, and did not lose even a shingle on the house. Across the street the tornado did extensive roof damage to a family house and barn, uplifting several large parts of it. Debris from the barn was thrown up to 300 yards downwind and in many different directions. The family said that they heard all the doors in the house shut tightly and heard a distinct roar. The tornado produced sporadic damage across farmland mainly in terms of trees, with more concentrated damage along Plum Run Road. Cedar tree damage was rather extensive with many cedars being snapped and twisted. Winds were around 90 mph here with a width of 40 yards. The tornado destroyed an old barn on Chester Hahn Road but weakened to an EF-0 of 80 mph and ended with a few snapped trees before Dugan Lane.", "F_scale": 1, "Wind": 95, "Source": "NWS Storm Survey", "Length": 4.0, "State_1": "KY", "State_2": null, "State_3": null }, "geometry": { "type": "LineString", "coordinates": [ [ -85.4211, 37.9195 ], [ -85.4192, 37.9188 ], [ -85.4165, 37.9165 ], [ -85.4151, 37.9149 ], [ -85.4142, 37.9145 ], [ -85.4099, 37.9131 ], [ -85.4049, 37.9124 ], [ -85.4041, 37.912 ], [ -85.4035, 37.9116 ], [ -85.4029, 37.9115 ], [ -85.3987, 37.9087 ], [ -85.3931, 37.9065 ], [ -85.386, 37.9054 ], [ -85.3837, 37.9028 ], [ -85.3821, 37.8977 ], [ -85.3823, 37.8959 ], [ -85.3808, 37.895 ], [ -85.3725, 37.8943 ], [ -85.3696, 37.8949 ] ] } },

The overall radar presentation of the co-located cyclonic rotation at the leading edge of the reflectivity surge improved near 2:50-2:56pm per the radar scans from KCYS. The first note of tree damage from the tornado occurred on Forest Service Road 115 (FS115) that ran west of the main Forest Service Road 100 (FS100) at an elevation around 9200 feet. Sporadic softwood pine trees were uprooted along FS115 and fell to the N/NW direction. The survey team continued north on FS100, and additional tree branches and smaller pine trees were uprooted. Progressing farther north along FS100, tree damage became more widespread and severe with degree of damage indicators increasing as more snapped softwood pine trees were cataloged and noted. This portion of FS100 decreases in elevation and into a narrow localized valley along Turpin Creek to the north and northwest. A vantage point at the south end of the valley, higher in elevation, allowed for a landscape view towards the main tree damage path. This enhanced visual perspective allowed the survey team to see east-northeast uprooted and bent softwood pine trees. There were also snapped pine trees down the main center line of the damage path oriented to the north to north-northwest, and softwood pine trees to the east of the main centerline, converging back to the west to northwest. It was noted the greatest tree damage on the south to middle portions of the local Turpin Creek Valley. This damage was located along the west side of FS100, crossed FS100, with the greatest snapping to the East as one progressed farther north along FS100. This evidence indicated the tornado crossed FS100 in following the main snapping of tree damage along with the notable convergent pattern of tree fall. From the south side of the local Valley, tree damage extended at least 100-200 yards west of the road, with a wider damage swath noted to the east of FS100 as one progressed farther north. The damage swath of uprooted and snapped trees east of FS100 was approximately 200-300 yards from the road. The damage area narrowed substantially and became indiscernible as the team progressed north towards Bow River Campground near the intersection of FS100 and FS101. The end point was marked at the north end of a concentrated area of tree debris, small tree uprooting, and dislodged branches at an elevation around 9000 feet.\nIt should be noted that sporadic tree damage was also noted both southwest and northwest of the main track and the concentrated damage area. Sporadic softwood pine uprooting was noted along FS100 just north of HWY 130, but showed no conclusive evidence of a converging pattern. Likewise, FS105, FS120, and FS111 also had sporadic trees down, but once again, all trees fell in a northerly direction.

It has been determined the damage was the result of a tornado. The tornado has been rated an EF-1 on the Enhanced Fujita Scale. Damage estimates were consistent with winds of 110 mph.\nThe tornado first touched down near Essen Park Avenue, just south of the Interstate 10 near Essen Lane. It produced minor roof damage to the Fairfield Inn, snapped a few smaller trees and knocked down a light pole. The tornado rapidly intensified, producing significantly more damage just moments later. As the tornado reached two Ammon Staffing buildings, it downed fencing, peeled the northern side metal roof of, and blew out a window on the east side of the building. Of the two buildings, the western one was damaged the most. More than half its flat roof was ripped off or collapsed. There was a partial collapse of the southwest exterior wall on the second story. It is suspected that a large limb or some other object hit that corner of the building, which could have aided in the lifting of the roof. No roof straps were seen during the survey. The tornado also damaged the roof of a building just to the east of the Ammon Staffing Buildings. Only the center section of the roof was removed and the rafters actually remained intact. Based on the overall damage of these 3 buildings, a peak wind speed of 110 mph was given at this point which was the strongest point of the tornado's track. These winds carried over into those building's parking lot to carry debris and, based on tire slide marks, may have pushed a vehicle through a chain link fence to the interstate on-ramp.\nThe tornado the crossed Interstate 10. On the north side of the interstate, it downed smaller trees, ripped off some vinyl siding and damaged the roof slightly. The tornado continued northeastward, downing several large trees and powerlines along Essen Heights Ct. The tornado then moved through Westminster, downing multiple trees across several streets. As the tornado passed over Westminster Elementary School, it damaged the school sign and ripped skirting of modular classrooms.

A strapped single-wide mobile home was rolled approximately 2 times, landing upside down. All walls were crushed. There were approximately 6 straps on each side of the mobile home. Each strap was either snapped or pulled the anchor out of ground, which was clay. The main I-beam portion of the mobile home frame displayed slight bending at the strap attachment points. For these reasons, the intensity was rated at EF-1, 105 mph. Another nearby mobile home was lifted enough to break its straps and set back down, upright. Multiple nearby trees were snapped. Its path width was approximately 50 yards at this time and it maintained that width throughout its lifecycle. The tornado continued northeast, crossing Mount Vernon Road. It passed between 2 homes, snapping about 10 softwood trees next to each other and uprooting a hardwood. The tornado continued northeast, uprooting and snapping softwood trees as it crossed Mississippi Highway 48. The tornado continued towards I-55, passing through densely wooded areas and open fields. As it crossed the interstate, it twisted limbs and blew down the Percy Quin State Park exit sign. The tornado continued northeast to the McComb/Pike County Airport. It flipped a strapped and anchored twin-engine propeller driven aircraft. It ripped all 3 doors off one of the main hangers, each around 25 foot by 25 foot in size. 2 were thrown 60 yards to north and the 3rd one was thrown 75 yards to the east. After the hanger doors were removed, the wind was able to enter the hanger and bulged out the bottom of the back wall approximately 2 feet. Minor glass and roof damage occurred to the adjacent office building. The intensity at the airport was EF-1, 90 mph. The tornado quickly lifted after passing the airport.", "F_scale": 1, "Wind": 105, "Source": "NWS Storm Survey", "Length": 2.0, "State_1": "MS", "State_2": null, "State_3": null }, "geometry": { "type": "LineString", "coordinates": [ [ -90.470102516, 31.18398989100001 ], [ -90.491045203999988, 31.174957701999972 ], [ -90.501248326999985, 31.171937601000025 ] ] } },

This survey, coupled with radar analysis from the NWS's KLWX WSR-88D and the FAAs TBWI Doppler Weather Radars, concluded that a tornado rated EF1 on the Enhanced Fujita scale with max winds of 95 mph struck between 2:37 PM and 2:42 PM EST. The tornado had a path length of 3.4 miles producing consistent damage, with a path width of up to 75 yards. The tornado was moving north-northeast at approximately 40 MPH.\nThe first reported damage was along Bainbridge Road near the intersection with Frenchtown Road, about 1 mile east of the town center of Port Deposit, MD, where several trees were uprooted and snapped near a residence. Tree damage continued into the woods northeast of the property, where tops of some trees were snapped and twisted. The storm moved to the northeast, uprooting more trees along Craigtown Road near the intersection with Perrylawn Drive. Reports from the day before noted more trees were down prior to our ground survey, but had to be cleared from roadways. Numerous trees were reported down behind the convenience store at that intersection.\nThe tornado continued towards the northeast through a large field before reaching Jackson Park Road. Along that road there was evidence of powerline damage, where new poles had just been installed near a residence. Additionally, there was tree debris in the yard, but the direction of fall could not be determined in this area. The tornado continued northeast, passing over a residence on Theodore Road where multiple trees were snapped, uprooted, and twisted in multiple directions. Additionally, there was a power pole replaced in front of the home that was confirmed to have been snapped during the tornado.\nThe tornado strengthened as it continued northeast, and moved into communities along Hopewell Road. The most severe damage noted occurred to homes on Hopewell Court and Bullet Street, where there was structural damage noted to several homes. Damage included shingle and siding damage, and a garage door bent inward. The strongest wind noted lifted off and removed the front porch awning of one home's roof. The debris was blown over and behind the home. In addition to the structural damage here, there were several trees uprooted and snapped in various directions. One tree fell onto and crushed a back porch. A resident on Hopewell Court reported seeing the tornado as it went by her home. Based on the damage, winds were estimated to have peaked here at 95 MPH.\nFinally, there was tree damage observed along Twin Lakes Road, just northeast of the previous two streets noted. The tornado then moved off into a large field and lifted. At the next crossing of Hopewell Road to the northeast, there were no signs of damage. Therefore, the survey concludes that the path ended in the vicinity of Twin Lakes Road.", "F_scale": 1, "Wind": 95, "Source": "NWS Storm Survey", "Length": 3.36, "State_1": "MD", "State_2": null, "State_3": null }, "geometry": { "type": "LineString", "coordinates": [ [ -76.096961711, 39.602847178 ], [ -76.086018298, 39.612633869 ], [ -76.075117801, 39.624468626 ], [ -76.071083758, 39.634318362 ], [ -76.066963885, 39.640729852 ], [ -76.06323025, 39.644497151 ] ] } },
