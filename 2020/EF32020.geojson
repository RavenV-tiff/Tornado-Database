This tornado touched down west of River Road Pike then moved eastward across Bells Bend, destroying a barn and blowing down numerous trees. The tornado strengthened significantly and widened to 0.65 miles wide as it crossed the Cumberland River into the John C. Tune Airport area, causing strong EF-2 damage to numerous planes, hangers, warehouses, and other buildings from Cockrill Bend Way to Briley Parkway. Around $200 million in damage was reported at John C. Tune Airport alone. Continuing eastward, the tornado caused severe damage to the Tennessee State Prison and blew down numerous high-tension transmission towers as it again crossed the Cumberland River into North Nashville, with up to EF-2 damage to farm facilities at Tennessee State University and dozens of homes between I-40 and Buchanan Street. EF-2 damage continued across the Germantown neighborhood just 1/2 mile north of downtown Nashville with several damaged and destroyed apartment complexes, homes, and businesses. The tornado intensified further as it tracked through East Nashville, with EF-3 damage to businesses and other buildings in the Five Points area and EF-2 damage to homes in the Lockeland Springs and Barclay Drive neighborhoods. Two people were killed in Five Points after leaving a bar and going outside as the tornado struck. After crossing the Cumberland River yet again, the tornado weakened as it moved northeast through the Donelson Hills and Lincoya Hills neighborhoods of Donelson, but strengthened again to a strong EF-3 in the Standford Estates area where several homes were leveled. The tornado weakened slightly but continued to cause EF-2 damage to homes and businesses as it turned southeast and passed through Hermitage into Wilson County.\nDozens of homes continued to sustain up to EF-2 damage as the tornado moved across the Chandler Road and Triple Crown Parkway neighborhoods of Mount Juliet. Turning more to the northeast, the tornado strenghtened to strong EF-3 and leveled numerous homes in the Catalpa Drive and Clearview Drive neighborhoods, with one elderly couple killed on Catalpa Drive at Dogwood Drive. Crossing Mount Juliet Road, the tornado severely damaged West Wilson Middle School and Stoner Creek Elementary School, both of which will have to be torn down and rebuilt. The tornado reached its peak intensity of high-end EF-3 and peak size of 0.9 miles wide as it moved across Golden Bear Parkway and along Eastgate Blvd, leveling several large warehouses and killing a security guard at the CEVA warehouse on Athletes Way North. Crossing Highway 109 into Lebanon, the tornado weakened to EF-2 but continued damaging dozens of homes and businesses as it moved through southern sections of the city. Further to the east, buildings on both sides of I-40 in Tuckers Crossroads received up to EF-2 damage before the tornado turned southeast and crossed into Smith County. Weakening and shrinking in size, the tornado caused EF-1 damage to numerous homes and businesses in Grant, New Middleton, and just south of Gordonsville. The tornado finally lifted east of Highway 141 and north of Judkins Lane after a continuous 60.13 miles on the ground.

As it moved through this area, it downed and snapped hundreds of trees, many of which fell onto homes. As the tornado crossed Sandal Street, it caused minor structural damage to several single-wide manufactured homes before tipping over a trailer as it crossed Jonesboro Road. The tornado then proceeded onward to break the metal trusses and bring down a wood chip conveyor belt onto a train at the Graphic Packaging International Paper Mill. As the tornado continued, it crossed the Ouachita River twice where it bends sharply before increasing intensity along Riverbend Drive. This increase in intensity was most notable from the many tree trunks snapped, the roof ripped off of a single family home, and the collapsed wall of another single family home.\nThe tornado then crossed the Ouachita River again and partially damaged the roof of the Masur Museum of Art, missing Downtown Monroe by roughly a mile. As it crossed South Grand Street, it then ripped the roof off of a two story home and continued on to damage the roofs of several homes and downed trees until it crossed the intersection of Highway 165 and Interstate 20. There, it damaged a metal building structure and snapped a wooden power pole and steel light assembly as it crossed Millhaven Road. Numerous other power poles were snapped and blown over across Millhaven Road. Two semi trucks were also blown over near the Highway 165/Interstate 20 intersection as well.\nThe worst damage from the tornado then occurred along Orchid Drive where it ripped the roof off of three homes and collapsed much of the exterior walls of one of the homes. It is believed that a mesovortex within the tornado led to this narrow corridor of more intense damage. After the tornado moved out of this subdivision, damage became more sporadic and the tornado touch down several more times before it destroyed a metal hangar housing several airplanes at the Monroe Regional Airport. The tornado then lifted as it crossed a runway at the airport.\nInitial estimates from the Ouachita Parish Office of Homeland Security and Emergency Preparedness indicate that a total of 458 homes across the parish were impacted by this tornado and the two other tornadoes which also touched down near the Sterlington community in Northern Ouachita Parish that same morning of April 12th. Of these homes, 23 homes were destroyed, 108 had major damage, 243 with minor damage, and another 84 homes were affected across the parish.

This widespread tree damage was confirmed from drone video from the Ouachita Parish Office of Homeland Security and Emergency Preparedness (OHSEP) and photos from the University of Louisiana Monroe. This forested area is where the tornado is believed to be strongest based on tree damage and radar imagery, but there were not sufficient damage indicators available to rate winds any higher than 140 mph (EF-3).\nAfter passing through the forested area, the tornado ripped the roof off of two single family homes and destroyed an outbuilding along End of Line Road.

Some of the communities impacted include Oak Vale, the area north of Carson, the north side of Collins, Hot Coffee, Summerland, Stringer, and the west side of Paulding. This tornado is preliminarily rated EF3 with an estimated peak wind of 150 MPH near MS Highway 35 northeast of Carson in Jefferson Davis County. The maximum path width was 1.16 miles also near MS Highway 35 in Jefferson Davis County. No fatalities were reported in this tornado, but there was an undetermined number of injuries. Additional details on the damage path and area of most significant damage follow.\n\nThe tornado initially touched down in southeastern Lawrence County 11 miles south of the city of Monticello, causing minor tree damage. The tornado quickly strengthened as it took a northeast track, producing EF1 and EF2 tree damage along Givens Road and Divide Road. From an elevated location on Divide Road, surveyors were able to view extensive tree damage and ground scouring in the inaccessible Pearl River bottom in Lawrence County. This damage was also confirmed by satellite imagery. The tornado destroyed the roof of a home and completely destroyed a metal building structure on Rayborn Lane. The homeowner also stated that a well built log cabin that he owned along the Pearl River was completely destroyed. After crossing the Pearl River, the tornado proceeded to impact areas just east of the river, causing more significant tree damage along River Road and Coon Hunting Road. The tornado completely destroyed several chicken houses and significantly damaged two homes near MS Highway 43 before crossing into Jefferson Davis County. Once in Jefferson Davis County, the tornado snapped and uprooted numerous trees along Johnson Road, Palestine Road, and Lily Rose Road. The tornado crossed MS Highway 13 snapping a couple of wooden power poles and causing damage to large sections of the roof of a one- story home. Two mobile homes were destroyed along Greens Creek Road, with additional roof damage to homes as well as snapping and uprooting trees as the tornado progressed northeastward. A mobile home was destroyed along Newman Camp Road.\n\nThe intensity of the tornado briefly increased to low end EF3 damage as it moved across Kirkley Lane, where extensive tree damage was noted. Damage to roofs, and the snapping and uprooting of trees continued as the tornado moved northeast. Large sections of a roof were removed from a one-story home on Haynes Gray Road, most walls of an apparently abandoned home were collapsed on SJ Garner Road, and the roof of a well built home was removed along Ross McPhail Road. Along Berry Loop, a mobile home was demolished and several other homes were heavily damaged.\n\nAs the tornado neared MS Highway 35 and the Terrell community, it grew wider and stronger. Extensive tree damage and varying degrees of damage occurred to dozens of structures. In this area, multiple mobile homes were completely destroyed on both sides of the highway. A large church made of cinderblocks was leveled here and supportive of EF3 wind speeds near 150 mph. Multiple power lines were downed as well. The tornado reached its widest point in this location at 1.16 miles. EF3 tree damage continued as it crossed East Granby Road near the river as well as a small section when it crossed Three Notch Road. Several mobile homes were destroyed here as well. The tornado weakened a bit after this point, but remained strong as it crossed US 84 and neared US 49. A wide swath of extensive tree damage and downed power lines occurred along the path. A set of chicken houses west of Campbell Faler Road was destroyed, and a mobile home was rolled. As the tornado crossed Old Macintosh and Sunset Roads, more trees were downed along with some damage to structures. After crossing US 49, this strong tornado continued northeast where numerous trees were snapped and uprooted and a mobile home was destroyed on Hambone Road.\n\nThe tornado continued across northeastern Covington County, crossing MS Highway 532 west of Hot Coffee, causing widespread tree damage and minor roof damage to some residential areas before crossing out of the county. The tornado then moved into northwest Jones and southern Smith County and crossed through the community of Summerland. Widespread tree damage continued through here, with some minor roof damage to residences, which was consistent with high end EF1 damage. A church along Smith County Road 8A had a steeple removed by the winds. The tornado then moved into southwestern Jasper County into the Stringer community. High end EF1 damage occurred in the area, with numerous trees snapped and uprooted in addition to a snapped power pole east of the community. Even though the circulation began to weaken, the tornado continued northeast and produced high end EF1 damage throughout central Jasper County before moving across the western side of Paulding. The tornado weakened in this area, still producing widespread EF0-EF1 tree damage as it crossed MS Highway 503 north of Paulding. The tornado lifted shortly thereafter along County Road 31. The maximum wind speed was 150mph in Jefferson Davis County.

The tornado strengthened quickly as it moved northeast and approached the industrial area of Fort Oglethorpe along Battlefield Parkway. Several businesses sustained structural damage, including a metal building structure along Howard Drive completely losing an exterior wall and part of its roof. It was in this area that a weather station at the Fort Oglethorpe Public Works Department measured a wind gust of 106 MPH. The tornado continued to the northeast, snapping or uprooting trees with a few homes sustaining roof and siding damage from Park Forrest Drive along Cloud Springs Road to Carrol Drive and Karen Drive. The tornado crossed I-75 around Scruggs Road, then crossed the Tennessee-Georgia state line between Scruggs Road and Georgia Highway 41. Ground surveys and radar data suggest the tornado touched down on the south side of Fort Oglethorpe, near the Chickamauga Battlefield Visitor Center in Catoosa County. The tornado crossed I-75 along Scruggs Road, then crossed the Tennessee/Georgia state-line somewhere between Scruggs Road and GA-Hwy 41 (Ringgold Rd in Tennessee). It quickly moved across the Harris Hills area where some trees were uprooted and then continued towards East Brainerd Road and Stratman Circle where an auto parts store was completely leveled and nearby structures had significant roof damage done. The tornado then struck the end of a large shopping building where a restaurant was located. The restaurant facade was destroyed and the roof was peeled back. This is where the tornado picked up strength and was near its peak intensity. It continued northeast into the Drake Forest neighborhood where extensive structure, roof, and tree damage was noted. There were likely pockets of EF-3 damage here, as well. The tornado damage path really widened as it moved northeast into the Holly Hills neighborhood. This was likely the widest part of the tornado. Nearly as far as you could see to the southeast, tree trunks were snapped and significant home damage was noted. Some areas were blocked by tree debris and fallen power poles as well as large debris removal machinery which limited easy access to some areas. Additional damage was found in Ooltewah near the Summit Softball Complex and particularly significant roof damage to several units/buildings of the Integra Hills Preserve Apartments. The tornado weakened as it crossed South Lee Highway and eventually dissipated in southwestern Bradley County. This tornado started near Fort Oglethorpe, Georgia in Catoosa County and tracked across eastern Hamilton County in Tennessee. The tornado weakened as it crossed South Lee Highway and eventually dissipated in southwestern Bradley County. The tornado crossed into Bradley County approximately 1.9 miles southwest of McDonald.

The tornado then continued east-northeast snapping and uprooting trees, with significant damage to at least one home off of Myrtle Lane, and minor roof and siding damage to approximately four additional homes just south of Bullhead Road. The tornado then dissipated near the intersection of Myrtle Lane and Wright Road. This tornado was part of a family of tornadoes that began more than 100 miles to the southwest, in Screven County, Georgia.", "F_scale": 3, "Wind": 145, "Source": "NWS Storm Survey", "State_1": "SC", "State_2": null, "State_3": null }, "geometry": { "type": "LineString", "coordinates": [ [ -79.990068564000012, 33.181639732 ], [ -79.986716904, 33.182282929999985 ], [ -79.982386661000021, 33.182411364000018 ], [ -79.972862731000021, 33.181635243000017 ], [ -79.962508172000014, 33.182948378999981 ], [ -79.95027201, 33.18533861200001 ], [ -79.938886652, 33.189966821999974 ], [ -79.918564344, 33.199406005000014 ], [ -79.909620835999988, 33.202318537 ], [ -79.900404470000012, 33.203087830000015 ], [ -79.894660242999976, 33.204541365000011 ] ] } },

Some of the most significant damage was in Paradise Acres area of Onalaska. Winds possibly reached 140 mph as the storm moved across this location, which was the only EF3 damage the NWS could confirm along the 30 mile track. The tornado killed three and injured 33 in Onalaska with 291 homes affected and 46 destroyed. It was estimated to be about 500 yards wide as it moved across the town. The tornado continued a general east- northeastward track across rural Polk county where it snapped and uprooted numerous hardwood and softwood trees and intermittently damaged structures. The tornado path was measured at just over a half-mile wide as it crossed Highway 59 near Seven Oaks, where EF2 damage was surveyed with destruction of two mobile homes and damage to hardwood trees. The tornado remained in rural areas until it ended very close to Barnes in northeast Polk county. Near the end of the track, a large tree destroyed a mobile home and miraculously just missed a man who was sitting at his computer. He was not seriously injured. For historical context, this was the deadliest single tornado for the NWS Houston-Galveston forecast area since Nov 15th, 1987 when a tornado also killed three in Madison County. The deadliest tornado on record for this area is the F4 in Galveston which killed 8 during Hurricane Carla in 1961.
